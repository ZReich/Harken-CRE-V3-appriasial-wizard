The above value conclusion is retrospective as of January 1, 2018 based on directions from the 
client. 
EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTIONS 
An extraordinary assumption is defined as “an assignment-specific assumption as of the effective 
date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis which, if found to be false, could alter 
the appraiser’s opinions or conclusions.”  1 
 
Information pertaining to the subject's physical characteristics was obtained from the Travis 
County Appraisal District and CoStar.  The improvements were not measured and the site was 
not surveyed by our firm.  If it is found that the subject site or improvement size differs from 
what is reported in this appraisal report, then we reserve the right to amend our findings and 
conclusions. 
 
Our value conclusion is contingent on the extraordinary assumption that the subject property 
is in good repair and does not suffer from any known items of deferred maintenance as of 
the date of value. 
HYPOTHETICAL CONDITIONS 
A hypothetical condition is defined as “a condition, directly related to a specific assignment, 
which is contrary to what is known by the appraiser to exist on the effective date of the 
assignment results, but is used for the purposes of analysis.”  2 
 
None noted.

Introduction 
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
The subject is a 72,720-square foot, four-story, suburban office building located at 844 E 
Anderson Lane in Austin, Texas. The improvements were constructed in 1975 and are situated on 
a 2.95-acre site.  Currently, the facility is considered to be in fair condition.   
LEGAL DESCRIPTION 
Lot 1 and 2, R.E. Austin Subdivision, Travis County, Texas. 
OWNERSHIP AND PROPERTY HISTORY 
Based on our review of the Travis County Appraisal District data, title to the property is currently 
vested in the name of Westcap Corporation who acquired title to the property in January 2009, 
for an unknown amount, as recorded in the Travis County Deed Records. The conditions 
surrounding this transaction of the subject were not provided to the appraisers.   
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no ownership transfer of the property during the 
previous three years.  According to CoStar, the subject is currently offered for sale by JLL, with an 
offering price of $9,350,000 or $128.58 per square foot and has been on the market for 
approximately 2 months.  The property is currently vacant and being marketed for sale as vacant. 
Based on our analysis herein, the current listing price is above the indicated market value, but is 
considered reasonable as it represents the positive perspective of an offering.  
INTENDED USE OF REPORT 
This appraisal is to be used for estimating the market value of fee simple interest of the subject 
property. 
INTENDED USER OF REPORT 
This appraisal is to be used by the Travis Central Appraisal District (Client), and no other user 
may rely on our report unless as specifically indicated in the report. 
Intended Users - the intended user is the person (or entity) who the appraiser intends 
will use the results of the appraisal.  The client may provide the appraiser with 
information about other potential users of the appraisal, but the appraiser ultimately 
determines who the appropriate users are given the appraisal problem to be solved.  
Identifying the intended users is necessary so that the appraiser can report the 
opinions and conclusions developed in the appraisal in a manner that is clear and 
understandable to the intended users.  Parties who receive or might receive a copy of

equivalent under prevailing market conditions if: 
(A) exposed for sale in the open market with a reasonable time for the seller to 
find a purchaser; 
(B) both the seller and the purchaser know of all the uses and purposes to which 
the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used and of the 
enforceable restrictions on its use; and 
(C) both the seller and purchaser seek to maximize their gains and neither is in a 
position to take advantage of the exigencies of the other. 4.   
INTEREST APPRAISED 
The value estimated represents the fee simple interest and defined as follows: 
Fee Simple Estate - Absolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest or estate, 
subject only to the limitations imposed by the governmental powers of taxation, 
eminent domain, police power and escheat. 5

LAND USE 
Land uses within the subject neighborhood consist of a mixture of commercial and residential 
developments and vacant acreage.  The immediate area of the subject property is improved 
primarily with light industrial and office uses.  The subject is situated west of the Walnut Creek 
Business Park, a 700-acre master planned office and technology park.  Within the business park, 
land uses are exclusive to commercial uses with approximately 70% of the developed tracts 
utilized as flex/distribution facilities and the remaining 30% utilized as low-rise office space.  The 
majority of properties have been built within the past twenty-five years and are situated along 
Cross Park and Exchange Drives, as well as Cameron, Dessau, and Sprinkle Roads.  Other 
commercial uses in the neighborhood consist of various retail uses that are situated along 
Anderson Lane East (Highway 183) and Cameron Road in the southern portion of the 
neighborhood and Dessau Road and Braker Lane in the northern portion of the neighborhood.  
The majority of residential enclaves are situated proximate to Interstate Highway 35.  Multi-family 
development has been scattered but the largest concentration has occurred along Rundberg and 
Braker Lanes.  Single-family residential development within a three-mile radius of the subject is 
best described as tract homes in the $100,000-$300,000 price range.  According to information 
obtained from ESRI, approximately 45% of the homes built within a three-mile radius of the 
subject were constructed between 1970 and 1990.   
Primary employers for residents include the full range of employers in central Austin to the south 
and Dell Computers in Round Rock to the north, as well as high-tech employers such as 
Samsung, IBM, Motorola, Applied Materials, Austin Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and

other technologically-oriented companies.  Interstate Highway 35 provides north-south access to 
various employment centers. 
The subject's immediate area benefits from good access to these commercial and residential 
districts along with proximity to several large employers in the immediate area.  The facilities 
include Dell Computers main campus, secondary campus, and the Samsung Semiconductor 
plant.  Despite recent job cuts at Dell, this facility still represents the region’s largest employer.  In 
contrast to Dell, Samsung completed a 35,000-square foot expansion, in April 2006 Samsung 
opened a new semi-conductor facility in Austin.   
GROWTH PATTERNS 
Growth patterns have occurred along primary commercial thoroughfares such as Interstate 
Highway 35, US Highway 183, Anderson Lane, Cameron Road, Dessau Road, and Braker Lane.  
The immediate area around the subject property is improved with a mixture of commercial uses, 
including office, flex, and industrial uses.  Retail development has been limited over the past five 
years in the immediate area due to the lack of available land tracts along major thoroughfares 
with good access/visibility.   
Although the immediate area has experienced moderate growth with respect to population and 
households over the past few years, the overall Austin MSA has experienced significant growth.  
City officials have encouraged development in established areas proximate the CBD in an effort 
to curtail urban sprawl.  An example of this is seen in the redevelopment of the Robert Mueller 
Airport, located just south of the subject along the east side of Interstate Highway 35 at 51st 
Street.  Dell’s children’s hospital provides an anchor to the mixed-use development, which 
includes retail, apartment, townhouse, office, and park uses. 
ACCESS 
Primary access to the subject neighborhood is provided by Interstate Highway 35, Research 
Boulevard (US Highway 183), and US Highway 290.  Interstate Highway 35 traverses the city in a 
north-south direction and connects Austin with the cities of Waco and Dallas/Ft. Worth to the 
north, and the city of San Antonio to the south.  US Highway 290 provides east-west access to the 
area and connects the city of Austin with city of Houston to the east.  Highway 290 merges with 
Interstate Highway 35 about two miles south of the subject.  Additionally, US Highway 183 
traverses the neighborhood in an east-west direction, before turning south and providing the area 
with access to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.  Secondary access to the neighborhood is 
provided by State Highway 130, Cameron Road, Rundberg Lane, Braker Lane, and Parmer Lane. 
The commute to the Austin Central Business District is approximately twenty minutes depending 
on traffic levels.  The Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is also about a twenty-minute drive 
from the subject neighborhood.

Barriers to Entry 
The City of Austin and its surrounding towns have a tight control over new development.  This is 
due in large part to the limited growth control the area has maintained for the past 20-30 years.  
Development approval in the area can take several years, which limits the amount of new growth 
in any particular area of the region.  These restrictions are known to be the most restrictive for 
new development in the State of Texas.  Additionally, the subject property is situated within an 
area where there are little if any vacant land tracts that would facilitate office or retail use.   
Demand Generators 
According to a study completed by Forbes.com, Austin ranks #1 among the cities best positions 
to grow and prosper in the next decade (based on the 52 largest metro areas in the country).  
Austin, Texas “has it all demographically: high rates of immigration and migration of educated 
workers and healthy increases in population and number of children. They are also economic 
superstars, with job-creation records among the best in the nation”. Primary employers for 
residents include the full range of employers in central Austin to the south and Dell Computers in 
Round Rock to the north, as well as high-tech employers such as Samsung, IBM, Motorola, 
Applied Materials, Austin Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and other technologically-
oriented companies.  Interstate Highway 35 provides north-south access to various employment 
centers. 
The subject's immediate area benefits from good access to Interstate Highway 35 and various 
employment centers. Employers for the neighborhood include high-tech employers such as 
Samsung, IBM, Motorola, Applied Materials, Austin Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and 
other technologically-oriented companies.

CONCLUSION 
Austin continues to be a much-desired market for office users due the city’s low occupancy cost 
and natural amenities. With a highly educated and versatile workforce, great quality of life, and 
low cost of living, Austin stands out as one of America’s best places to do business.   
With respect to the subject in particular, we believe the subject is suitably located for an office 
product.  The project has good access to IH-35, US Highway 183 and Highway 290.  It is in 
reasonable proximity to both employment centers and major roadways.

Highest and Best Use 
27 
 
Highest and Best Use 
In appraisal practice, the concept of highest and best use represents the premise upon which 
value is based.  The four criteria the highest and best use must meet are: 
 
legally permissible; 
 
physically possible; 
 
financially feasible; and 
 
maximally productive. 
The highest and best use analysis of the subject is discussed below.  
AS VACANT 
The property is zoned for office use and is of sufficient size to accommodate various types of 
development. The immediate area includes various office land uses. Considering the surrounding 
land uses, location attributes, legal restrictions and other factors, it is our opinion that an office 
use would be reasonable and appropriate.  Therefore, it is our opinion that the highest and best 
use would be for office development, time and circumstances warranting. 
AS IMPROVED 
As improved, the subject involves an office-oriented facility.  The current use is legally permissible 
and physically possible.  The improvements continue to contribute value to the property and 
based on our analysis, the existing use is financially feasible.  Therefore, it is our opinion that the 
highest and best use of the subject, as improved, is for continued office related use.

Appraisal Methodology 
28 
 
Appraisal Methodology 
In appraisal practice, an approach to value is included or omitted based on its applicability to the 
property type being valued and the quality and quantity of information available. 
COST APPROACH 
The cost approach is based on the proposition that the informed purchaser would pay no more 
for the subject than the cost to produce a substitute property with equivalent utility.  This approach 
is particularly applicable when the property being appraised involves relatively new improvements 
that represent the highest and best use of the land, or when it is improved with relatively unique 
or specialized improvements for which there exist few sales or leases of comparable properties. 
SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
The sales comparison approach utilizes sales of comparable properties, adjusted for differences, 
to indicate a value for the subject. Valuation is typically accomplished using physical units of 
comparison such as price per square foot, price per unit, price per floor, etc., or economic units 
of comparison such as gross rent multiplier.  Adjustments are applied to the physical units of 
comparison derived from the comparable sale.  The unit of comparison chosen for the subject is 
then used to yield a total value.  Economic units of comparison are not adjusted, but rather 
analyzed as to relevant differences, with the final estimate derived based on the general 
comparisons. 
INCOME CAPITALIZATION APPROACH 
The income capitalization approach reflects the subject’s income-producing capabilities.  This 
approach is based on the assumption that value is created by the expectation of benefits to be 
derived in the future.  Specifically estimated is the amount an investor would be willing to pay to 
receive an income stream plus reversion value from a property over a period of time.  The two 
common valuation techniques associated with the income capitalization approach are direct 
capitalization and the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.  
METHODOLOGY APPLICABLE TO THE SUBJECT 
In valuing the subject, all three approaches are applicable and have been utilized.

Cost Approach

Cost Approach 
In estimating the replacement cost new for the subject, the following methods/data sources have 
been utilized (where available): 
 
the comparative unit method has been employed, utilizing the Marshall Valuation Service 
(MVS) cost guide, published by Marshall and Swift, LLC. 
MARSHALL VALUATION SERVICE 
Direct Cost 
Salient details regarding the direct costs are summarized in the Cost Approach Conclusion at the 
end of this section.  The MVS cost estimates include the following: 
1. average architect’s and engineer’s fees for plans, plan check, building permits and 
survey(s) to establish building line; 
2. normal interest in building funds during the period of construction plus a processing fee 
or service charge; 
3. materials, sales taxes on materials, and labor costs; 
4. normal site preparation including finish grading and excavation for foundation and 
backfill; 
5. utilities from structure to lot line figured for typical setback; 
6. contractor’s overhead and profit, including job supervision, workmen’s compensation, 
fire and liability insurance, unemployment insurance, equipment, temporary facilities, 
security, etc.; 
7. site improvements (included as lump sum additions); and 
8. initial tenant improvement costs are included in MVS cost estimate.  However, additional 
lease-up costs such as advertising, marketing and leasing commissions are not 
included. 
Base building costs (direct costs) are adjusted to reflect the physical characteristics of the subject.  
Making these adjustments, including the appropriate local and current cost multipliers, the direct 
building cost is indicated. 
Additions 
Items not included in the direct building cost estimate include parking and walks, signage, 
landscaping, and miscellaneous site improvements.  The cost for these items is estimated 
separately using the segregated cost sections of the MVS cost guide. 
Indirect Cost Items 
Several indirect cost items are not included in the direct building cost figures derived through the 
MVS cost guide.  These items include developer overhead (general and administrative costs), 
property taxes, legal and insurance costs, local development fees and contingencies, lease-up 
and marketing costs and miscellaneous costs.  The concluded indirect cost allowance is 10.0%.

Pond Springs Road in Austin. The improvements were constructed in 1986 and are situated on a 
0.876-acre site. The property includes surface parking with a ratio of 2.91 per 1,000 square feet. 
The property was 100.0% occupied at the time of the transaction. The property is sold for 
$1,950,000 or $153.28 per square foot in May of 2017.  The implied OAR was 6.89%.  
Improved Sale Two 
This comparable represents a 23,859-square foot, single-tenant office property located at 1029 
Camino La Costa in Austin, Texas.  The property was constructed in 2005, and is in average 
overall condition.  It is 100% leased to the GSA, Social Security Administrations (SSA) on a 15-
year term that expires in December 2020.  The current lease rate is $28.75 per square foot on a 
modified gross lease basis in which the tenant reimburses the landlord for real estate taxes over 
$2.62/SF only.  The property sold in March of 2017 for $4,100,000 or $171.84 per square foot.  
The implied OAR was 8.25%. 
Improved Sale Three 
This comparable represents a 14,518-square-foot, Class B single-tenant office property, which is 
situated on a 0.93-acre parcel at 1005 La Posada Drive, Austin, Texas.  The 2-story 
improvements were originally constructed in 1980 and were considered in average condition at 
the time of sale.  The property sold in August 2016 for $2,460,000, or $169.44 per square foot.  
The property was purchased by an owner user.  Pro Forma net operating income at the time of 
sale was $191,949, or $13.22 per square foot, for an implied overall capitalization rate of 7.8%.   
Improved Sale Four 
This comparable represents the sale of Center Creek Plaza, a 57,467-square foot, three-story, 
suburban office building located at 1812 Centre Creek Drive in Austin, Texas. The improvements 
were constructed in 1986 and are situated on a 3.82-acre site. The notable tenants are Intera 
and Caring Family Network. The property was 81.9% leased at the time of sale. It is considered

Group as part of a two-building portfolio transaction with an allocated price of $5,600,000 or 
$97.45 per square foot.  The comparable was not stabilized at the time of sale and required 
lease up costs (inclusive of rent loss, leasing commissions, and tenant improvements) along with 
deferred maintenance costs of $430,000 to be added to the purchase price.  Therefore, the 
effective stabilized purchase price was $6,030,000 or $104.93 per square foot.  The implied 
OAR was 7.76%.

ANALYSIS OF ADJUSTMENTS 
Property Rights Conveyed/Financing Terms/Conditions of Sale 
No adjustments are deemed to be warranted to the comparables for these factors.   
Market Conditions 
The comparables sold between May 2015 and May 2017.  An upward adjustment of 3.0% per 
year over this time period is warranted to account for improving market conditions, including 
improving occupancy and rental rates in the Austin MSA.   
Location 
The comparables are located in the greater Austin MSA and are located in generally similar office 
submarkets. Comparable 1 benefits from its superior neighborhood position in northwest Austin 
and was adjusted downward for location.  Comparable 4 is located farther east and does not 
benefit from direct access to a primary thoroughfare and was adjusted upward for this factor.  
Comparables 2 and 3 were not adjusted for location characteristics.  
Size (Economies of Scale) 
The subject is 72,720 SF in size, while the comparables range in size from 12,722 SF to 57,467 
SF.  Comparables 1, 2, and 3 were adjusted downward for economies of scale given their 
notably smaller size.  Comparable 4 is generally similar with regards to size and was not 
adjusted for economies of scale (size).   
Age/Condition 
The subject property was constructed in 1975 and is considered in fair condition.  The 
comparables were constructed between 1980 and 2005 and were adjusted for downward 
age/condition at variable rates depending on condition.   
Quality of Construction 
The subject property represents a Class B/Coffice building.  The comparables represent generally 
similar construction quality and were not adjusted for overall quality, including finish out, design, 
layout, and exterior construction components.   
Parking 
The subject property includes surface parking with a parking ratio of 3.44 per 1,000 SF.  
Comparables 1, 3, and 4 have surface parking with ratios ranging from 2.91 to 3.58 per 1,000 
SF and were not adjusted for parking. Comparable 2 has an above average parking ratio (5.32 
per 1,000 SF) and was adjusted downward for this factor.   
Tenancy 
Comparable 2 is fully leased to the GSA and was adjusted downward for this factor.  The 
remaining comparables do not warrant an adjustment for tenancy.

In a comparison of indicated OARs, an adjustment of approximately 25 to 100 basis points 
appears to be warranted for a fee simple analysis.  The fee simple OAR is derived based on an 
estimated market rent at the time of sale applied to the comparables less a vacancy and 
collection loss allowance and reserves for replacement. 
The remaining comparables include a range of tenancy in place at the time of sale; however, the 
tenancy is considered typical for Class B/C office buildings and an adjustment for tenancy or 
credit was not deemed warranted in comparison to a fee simple analysis.  Therefore, it is our 
conclusion that a fee simple capitalization rate for the subject property should be as outlined in 
the chart below.

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
1. Unless otherwise specifically noted in the body of the report, it is assumed that title to the property or properties 
appraised is clear and marketable and that there are no recorded or unrecorded matters or exceptions to title that 
would adversely affect marketability or value. CBRE, Inc. is not aware of any title defects nor has it been advised of 
any unless such is specifically noted in the report.  CBRE, Inc., however, has not examined title and makes no 
representations relative to the condition thereof.  Documents dealing with liens, encumbrances, easements, deed 
restrictions, clouds and other conditions that may affect the quality of title have not been reviewed.  Insurance 
against financial loss resulting in claims that may arise out of defects in the subject’s title should be sought from a 
qualified title company that issues or insures title to real property. 
2. Unless otherwise specifically noted in the body of this report, it is assumed: that the existing improvements on the 
property or properties being appraised are structurally sound, seismically safe and code conforming; that all 
building systems (mechanical/electrical, HVAC, elevator, plumbing, etc.) are in good working order with no major 
deferred maintenance or repair required; that the roof and exterior are in good condition and free from intrusion 
by the elements; that the property or properties have been engineered in such a manner that the improvements, as 
currently constituted, conform to all applicable local, state, and federal building codes and ordinances.  CBRE, Inc. 
professionals are not engineers and are not competent to judge matters of an engineering nature.  CBRE, Inc. has 
not retained independent structural, mechanical, electrical, or civil engineers in connection with this appraisal and, 
therefore, makes no representations relative to the condition of improvements.  Unless otherwise specifically noted 
in the body of the report: no problems were brought to the attention of CBRE, Inc. by ownership or management; 
CBRE, Inc. inspected less than 100% of the entire interior and exterior portions of the improvements; and CBRE, 
Inc. was not furnished any engineering studies by the owners or by the party requesting this appraisal.  If questions 
in these areas are critical to the decision process of the reader, the advice of competent engineering consultants 
should be obtained and relied upon.  It is specifically assumed that any knowledgeable and prudent purchaser 
would, as a precondition to closing a sale, obtain a satisfactory engineering report relative to the structural 
integrity of the property and the integrity of building systems.  Structural problems and/or building system 
problems may not be visually detectable.  If engineering consultants retained should report negative factors of a 
material nature, or if such are later discovered, relative to the condition of improvements, such information could 
have a substantial negative impact on the conclusions reported in this appraisal.  Accordingly, if negative findings 
are reported by engineering consultants, CBRE, Inc. reserves the right to amend the appraisal conclusions reported 
herein. 
3. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on 
the property was not observed by the appraisers.  CBRE, Inc. has no knowledge of the existence of such materials 
on or in the property.  CBRE, Inc., however, is not qualified to detect such substances.  The presence of substances 
such as asbestos, urea formaldehyde foam insulation, contaminated groundwater or other potentially hazardous 
materials may affect the value of the property.  The value estimate is predicated on the assumption that there is no 
such material on or in the property that would cause a loss in value.  No responsibility is assumed for any such 
conditions, or for any expertise or engineering knowledge required to discover them.  The client is urged to retain 
an expert in this field, if desired. 
We have inspected, as thoroughly as possible by observation, the land; however, it was impossible to personally 
inspect conditions beneath the soil.  Therefore, no representation is made as to these matters unless specifically 
considered in the appraisal. 
4. All furnishings, equipment and business operations, except as specifically stated and typically considered as part of 
real property, have been disregarded with only real property being considered in the report unless otherwise 
stated.  Any existing or proposed improvements, on or off-site, as well as any alterations or repairs considered, are 
assumed to be completed in a workmanlike manner according to standard practices based upon the information 
submitted to CBRE, Inc.  This report may be subject to amendment upon re-inspection of the subject subsequent to 
repairs, modifications, alterations and completed new construction.  Any estimate of Market Value is as of the date 
indicated; based upon the information, conditions and projected levels of operation. 
5. It is assumed that all factual data furnished by the client, property owner, owner’s representative, or persons 
designated by the client or owner to supply said data are accurate and correct unless otherwise specifically noted 
in the appraisal report.  Unless otherwise specifically noted in the appraisal report, CBRE, Inc. has no reason to 
believe that any of the data furnished contain any material error.  Information and data referred to in this 
paragraph include, without being limited to, numerical street addresses, lot and block numbers, Assessor’s Parcel 
Numbers, land dimensions, square footage area of the land, dimensions of the improvements, gross building 
areas, net rentable areas, usable areas, unit count, room count, rent schedules, income data, historical operating 
expenses, budgets, and related data.  Any material error in any of the above data could have a substantial impact

on the conclusions reported.  Thus, CBRE, Inc. reserves the right to amend conclusions reported if made aware of 
any such error.  Accordingly, the client-addressee should carefully review all assumptions, data, relevant 
calculations, and conclusions within 30 days after the date of delivery of this report and should immediately notify 
CBRE, Inc. of any questions or errors. 
6. The date of value to which any of the conclusions and opinions expressed in this report apply, is set forth in the 
Letter of Transmittal.  Further, that the dollar amount of any value opinion herein rendered is based upon the 
purchasing power of the American Dollar on that date.  This appraisal is based on market conditions existing as of 
the date of this appraisal.  Under the terms of the engagement, we will have no obligation to revise this report to 
reflect events or conditions which occur subsequent to the date of the appraisal.  However, CBRE, Inc. will be 
available to discuss the necessity for revision resulting from changes in economic or market factors affecting the 
subject. 
7. CBRE, Inc. assumes no private deed restrictions, limiting the use of the subject in any way. 
8. Unless otherwise noted in the body of the report, it is assumed that there are no mineral deposit or subsurface 
rights of value involved in this appraisal, whether they be gas, liquid, or solid.  Nor are the rights associated with 
extraction or exploration of such elements considered unless otherwise stated in this appraisal report.  Unless 
otherwise stated it is also assumed that there are no air or development rights of value that may be transferred. 
9. CBRE, Inc. is not aware of any contemplated public initiatives, governmental development controls, or rent controls 
that would significantly affect the value of the subject. 
10. The estimate of Market Value, which may be defined within the body of this report, is subject to change with 
market fluctuations over time.  Market value is highly related to exposure, time promotion effort, terms, motivation, 
and conclusions surrounding the offering.  The value estimate(s) consider the productivity and relative 
attractiveness of the property, both physically and economically, on the open market. 
11. Any cash flows included in the analysis are forecasts of estimated future operating characteristics are predicated 
on the information and assumptions contained within the report.  Any projections of income, expenses and 
economic conditions utilized in this report are not predictions of the future.  Rather, they are estimates of current 
market expectations of future income and expenses.  The achievement of the financial projections will be affected 
by fluctuating economic conditions and is dependent upon other future occurrences that cannot be assured.  
Actual results may vary from the projections considered herein.  CBRE, Inc. does not warrant these forecasts will 
occur.  Projections may be affected by circumstances beyond the current realm of knowledge or control of CBRE, 
Inc. 
12. Unless specifically set forth in the body of the report, nothing contained herein shall be construed to represent any 
direct or indirect recommendation of CBRE, Inc. to buy, sell, or hold the properties at the value stated.  Such 
decisions involve substantial investment strategy questions and must be specifically addressed in consultation form. 
13. Also, unless otherwise noted in the body of this report, it is assumed that no changes in the present zoning 
ordinances or regulations governing use, density, or shape are being considered.  The property is appraised 
assuming that all required licenses, certificates of occupancy, consents, or other legislative or administrative 
authority from any local, state, nor national government or private entity or organization have been or can be 
obtained or renewed for any use on which the value estimates contained in this report is based, unless otherwise 
stated. 
14. This study may not be duplicated in whole or in part without the specific written consent of CBRE, Inc. nor may this 
report or copies hereof be transmitted to third parties without said consent, which consent CBRE, Inc. reserves the 
right to deny.  Exempt from this restriction is duplication for the internal use of the client-addressee and/or 
transmission to attorneys, accountants, or advisors of the client-addressee.  Also exempt from this restriction is 
transmission of the report to any court, governmental authority, or regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the 
party/parties for whom this appraisal was prepared, provided that this report and/or its contents shall not be 
published, in whole or in part, in any public document without the express written consent of CBRE, Inc. which 
consent CBRE, Inc. reserves the right to deny.  Finally, this report shall not be advertised to the public or otherwise 
used to induce a third party to purchase the property or to make a “sale” or “offer for sale” of any “security”, as 
such terms are defined and used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Any third party, not covered by the 
exemptions herein, who may possess this report, is advised that they should rely on their own independently 
secured advice for any decision in connection with this property.  CBRE, Inc. shall have no accountability or 
responsibility to any such third party. 
15. Any value estimate provided in the report applies to the entire property, and any pro ration or division of the title 
into fractional interests will invalidate the value estimate, unless such pro ration or division of interests has been set 
forth in the report.

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions

16. The distribution of the total valuation in this report between land and improvements applies only under the existing 
program of utilization.  Component values for land and/or buildings are not intended to be used in conjunction 
with any other property or appraisal and are invalid if so used. 
17. The maps, plats, sketches, graphs, photographs and exhibits included in this report are for illustration purposes 
only and are to be utilized only to assist in visualizing matters discussed within this report.  Except as specifically 
stated, data relative to size or area of the subject and comparable properties has been obtained from sources 
deemed accurate and reliable.  None of the exhibits are to be removed, reproduced, or used apart from this 
report. 
18. No opinion is intended to be expressed on matters which may require legal expertise or specialized investigation 
or knowledge beyond that customarily employed by real estate appraisers.  Values and opinions expressed 
presume that environmental and other governmental restrictions/conditions by applicable agencies have been 
met, including but not limited to seismic hazards, flight patterns, decibel levels/noise envelopes, fire hazards, 
hillside ordinances, density, allowable uses, building codes, permits, licenses, etc.  No survey, engineering study or 
architectural analysis has been made known to CBRE, Inc.  unless otherwise stated within the body of this report.  If 
the Consultant has not been supplied with a termite inspection, survey or occupancy permit, no responsibility or 
representation is assumed or made for any costs associated with obtaining same or for any deficiencies discovered 
before or after they are obtained.  No representation or warranty is made concerning obtaining these items.  
CBRE, Inc. assumes no responsibility for any costs or consequences arising due to the need, or the lack of need, 
for flood hazard insurance.  An agent for the Federal Flood Insurance Program should be contacted to determine 
the actual need for Flood Hazard Insurance. 
19. Acceptance and/or use of this report constitutes full acceptance of the Contingent and Limiting Conditions and 
special assumptions set forth in this report.  It is the responsibility of the Client, or client’s designees, to read in full, 
comprehend and thus become aware of the aforementioned contingencies and limiting conditions.  Neither the 
Appraiser nor CBRE, Inc. assumes responsibility for any situation arising out of the Client’s failure to become 
familiar with and understand the same.  The Client is advised to retain experts in areas that fall outside the scope 
of the real estate appraisal/consulting profession if so desired. 
20. CBRE, Inc. assumes that the subject analyzed herein will be under prudent and competent management and 
ownership; neither inefficient or super-efficient. 
21. It is assumed that there is full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations 
and laws unless noncompliance is stated, defined and considered in the appraisal report. 
22. No survey of the boundaries of the property was undertaken.  All areas and dimensions furnished are presumed to 
be correct.  It is further assumed that no encroachments to the realty exist. 
23. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective January 26, 1992.  Notwithstanding any discussion of 
possible readily achievable barrier removal construction items in this report, CBRE, Inc. has not made a specific 
compliance survey and analysis of this property to determine whether it is in conformance with the various detailed 
requirements of the ADA.  It is possible that a compliance survey of the property together with a detailed analysis 
of the requirements of the ADA could reveal that the property is not in compliance with one or more of the 
requirements of the ADA.  If so, this fact could have a negative effect on the value estimated herein.  Since CBRE, 
Inc. has no specific information relating to this issue, nor is CBRE, Inc. qualified to make such an assessment, the 
effect of any possible non-compliance with the requirements of the ADA was not considered in estimating the value 
of the subject. 
24. Client shall not indemnify Appraiser or hold Appraiser harmless unless and only to the extent that the Client 
misrepresents, distorts, or provides incomplete or inaccurate appraisal results to others, which acts of the Client 
approximately result in damage to Appraiser.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Appraiser shall have no obligation 
under this Section with respect to any loss that is caused solely by the active negligence or willful misconduct of a 
Client and is not contributed to by any act or omission (including any failure to perform any duty imposed by law) 
by Appraiser.  Client shall indemnify and hold Appraiser harmless from any claims, expenses, judgments or other 
items or costs arising as a result of the Client's failure or the failure of any of the Client's agents to provide a 
complete copy of the appraisal report to any third party.  In the event of any litigation between the parties, the 
prevailing party to such litigation shall be entitled to recover, from the other, reasonable attorney fees and costs.

comparable sold in May 2015 to Congress Holdings Group as part of a two building portfolio transaction (inclusive of the Wells Fargo Office and 
Centre Creek Plaza) for a total price of $13,250,000. The sale was an off market transaction. However, the transaction was arm·s length.  The 
allocated price for Centre Creek Plaza was $5,600,000 or $97.45 per square foot.  The comparable was not stabilized at the time of sale and 
required lease up costs (inclusive of rent loss, leasing commissions, and tenant improvements) along with deferred maintenance costs of $430,000

new Agreement. 
Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in the Agreement shall create a contractual relationship 
between the Appraiser or the District and any third party, or any cause of action in favor of any 
third party.  This Agreement shall not be construed to render any person or entity a third party 
beneficiary of this Agreement, including but not limited to, any third parties identified herein.
