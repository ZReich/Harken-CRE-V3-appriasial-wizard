Dear First Security Bank of Missoula: 
Pursuant to your request I have prepared an appraisal of the above-described property. The purpose 
of this appraisal is to estimate the “As Is” market value of the fee simple estate. I have personally 
inspected the site and improvements valued in this report. I certify that I have no personal 
interest, present or contemplated, in the subject property and that this appraisal represents my 
opinion of the market value of the subject property. 
As a result of my investigation, the final estimated “As Is” market value of the fee simple estate, 
as of the date of last inspection, July 28, 2023, is: $1,750,000. The exposure time for the subject 
property is estimated to be less than six months.  
This letter must remain attached to the report, which contains 46 pages, plus related exhibits, in

PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL: 
 
The purpose of this appraisal is to provide the appraisers' best estimate of the market value 
of the subject real property as of the effective date. Market value is defined by the federal 
financial institutions regulatory agencies as follows: 
 
Market value means the most probable price which a property should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer 
and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not 
affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale 
as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions 
whereby: 
 
(1) 
buyer and seller are typically motivated;  
(2) 
both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they 
consider their own best interests; 
(3) 
a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;  
(4) 
payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial 
arrangements comparable thereto; and 
(5) 
the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected 
by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone 
associated with the sale.

APPRAISAL DEVELOPMENT & REPORTING PROCESS 
 
In preparing this appraisal, the appraiser: 
 
- 
Inspected the subject site and both the interior and exterior of the building.  
 
- 
Gathered information on comparable land sales, improved sales, and performed a 
rental survey of competitive rental properties located in Billings, Montana.  
 
- 
Confirmed and analyzed the data and applied the Cost, Sales Comparison, and 
Income Approaches to value. In the Income Approach, I used direct capitalization 
analysis. Direct capitalization arrives at value by capitalizing next year’s net 
operating income. 
 
All information pertinent to the valuation of the subject property is contained in the report. 
Supporting documentation used in arriving at market value is retained in the appraisers' 
file.

GENERAL AREA ANALYSIS 
 
The City of Billings, county seat of Yellowstone County, is located in the south central 
portion of Montana. More specifically, it is situated midway between Seattle, Washington 
and Minneapolis, Minnesota and approximately 550 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado. 
Billings is the largest city in Montana with a 2022 population estimate of 119,706 persons.  
This represents an 8.6% increase over the 2015 estimate of 110,263 persons. Yellowstone 
County has a 2022 population estimate of 168,083, which represents a 7% increase over 
the 2015 estimate of 157,048 persons. 
 
The City’s economy is generally characterized as diverse. The Billings trade area includes 
25 Montana counties and eight Wyoming counties and is considered one of the largest 
geographical trade areas in the nation.  As such, the City serves as a major wholesale and 
retail trade center. Agriculture has also been a traditionally strong part of the Billings 
economy.  Billings has the second largest livestock auction market in the nation and has 
always served as an important center for the growing and selling of such crops as wheat, 
barley, sugar beets, corn and oats.  
 
The Billings medical community consists of two major hospitals, several group practices, 
surgical groups, the Northern Rockies Regional Cancer Treatment Center and the South 
Central Montana Regional Mental Health Center.  These facilities contribute to making 
Billings the largest major medical center between Spokane and Minneapolis and north of 
Denver. Tourism and recreation also play an important role in Montana's economy. 
Billings' proximity to Yellowstone National Park, numerous ski resorts, and excellent 
hunting, fishing, camping and hiking opportunities make it a likely stop over point for the 
vacationer in this area.

     7      
In summary, the City of Billings is a viable metropolitan area with a diverse economy and 
a history of healthy, sustained growth. The growing viability of the community as a retail 
and wholesale trade center, the continued growth in the local medical community, and ever 
increasing levels of tourism all contributed to predictions by the University of Montana's 
Bureau of Business and Economic Research that Billings and Yellowstone County will 
likely be among the leaders in the state in population and economic growth over the next 
decade.

NEIGHBORHOOD ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
The subject is located along the north side of Entryway Drive, approximately ½ mile south 
of South Frontage Road in Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana. This location is 
approximately one mile east of the Zoo Drive/Interstate 90 interchange in southwest 
Billings. For the purposes of this report, the subject neighborhood is considered to be the 
commercially developed areas bounded by South Frontage Road to the north, the lots on 
the southern side of Tande Drive to the south, Byrne Boulevard to the west, and 
Shackleford Lane to the east. There is one east-west principal arterial roadway, South 
Frontage Road, and one north-south collector street, Goodman Road.

July 31, 2023 
 
     9      
The neighborhood is approximately 75% developed with light industrial properties. The 
remaining 25% is undeveloped industrial land. Notable properties within this area include 
Bridger Steel, Western Ranch Supply, Montana Honda and Marine, Slumberland 
Furniture, FedEx Freight, Tractor and Equipment Company, Beartooth Harley-Davidson, 
and Tvetene Turf. This area is predominantly light industrial properties with a handful of 
retail properties, which are located primarily along South Frontage Road. The subject is 
located toward the center of the defined area. 
 
In summary, the neighborhood is best characterized as a regional-oriented light industrial 
district. Continued expansion of Billings to the west and southwest coupled with the 
community’s continued importance as a regional trade center should tend to insure the 
economic viability of this area well into the foreseeable future.

suggests there is adequate site area for on-site parking, sidewalks, 
driving lanes, yard space, and landscaping.    
 
Easements: There are no existing or proposed easements that adversely impact          
value. 
 
           Zoning:           I1 – Light Industrial  
 
 
The light industrial zone is intended to accommodate a variety of 
business, warehouse, and light industrial uses related to wholesale 
plus other business and light industries. Low intensity light industrial 
development can be compatible with adjacent commercial zones. I1 
zoning should provide locations directly accessible to arterial and 
other transportation systems that can conveniently serve the business 
and industrial centers of the city and county. 
 
 
 
 The subject’s improvements are a permitted use of the site 
 
Utilities: 
Serviced by well and septic. Other utilities including electricity, 
natural gas, telephone and cable have been extended to the site. 
 
 
Access:       Access to the improvements is via a gravel approach located on the 
south side of the site from Entryway Drive. Access is considered to 
be good.  
 
 
 
  
Entryway Drive is a lightly traveled local street, used primarily by 
local businesses and their clients. This is an asphalt paved street that 
is unimproved. There is one east bound and one west bound travel 
lane. Entryway Drive terminates to the east at Tande Drive and to the 
west at Byrne Boulevard.

     12      
 
Topography: The subject is level and at street grade. The site has no distinguishing 
topographical features.  
  
Flood Hazard: The subject is not located in an identified flood hazard area.  
  
Adjacent Properties: 
 
 
North: Vacant commercial development lot; 
  
South: Across Entryway Drive is a vacant commercial development 
lot; 
 
 
East: Vacant commercial development lot; 
 
 
West:  Light industrial property (Truss Craft of Montana). 
 
Hazardous or Toxic Materials: 
 
A visual inspection of the site did not reveal any unusual soil conditions or hazardous waste 
materials that may be present on or under the site. I am not aware of a Phase I 
Environmental Assessment that has been made of the site; therefore, I cannot comment on 
actual soil conditions or the existence of hazardous wastes, if any, on/under the site. I am 
not an expert in detecting hazardous materials that may be present on/under the site, which 
materials may affect the value of the property. 
 
The value estimate is predicated upon the assumption there is no such material on the 
property. Any such environmental risk discovered at a later date may require a revised 
estimate of value that may or may not be simply a reduction of the value by the estimated 
cost to cure the environmental condition. Properties known to have environmental risk may 
also carry a stigma in the marketplace that may or may not affect the value. If future soil 
tests should reveal the existence of any unusual soil conditions or hazardous wastes, I 
reserve the right to review and adjust this appraisal accordingly.

PROPERTY OWNERSHIP 
The current owner of record is Bauer Development LLC. Bauer Development LLC 
acquired ownership from Harnish Trade Center, LLP via Warranty Deed #4019893 
recorded on June 13, 2022. The purchase price associated with this transaction was 
$240,595. This purchase was for the land only.  
Prior to this transaction, the subject had been under the ownership of Harnish Trade Center 
LLP for the five-year period preceding the date of valuation. 
There is currently a pending sale between Bauer Development LLC as the seller and Les 
and Wendy Klaudt/or assigns as the buyer. The pending purchase price is $1,750,000. This 
sale is to close ten days from the full release of contingencies, or a date agreed upon 
between both parties. As per the results of this appraisal, I have determined that the pending 
sales price is reflective of market value.

HIGHEST AND BEST USE 
 
In estimating the site’s highest and best use, legal controls, such as zoning, must be 
considered, along with investor attitudes and the financial feasibility of the alternative uses. 
Major types of real estate uses, consisting of agricultural, residential, recreational, 
industrial, commercial and public use, were considered. It is obvious that several of these 
uses can be immediately eliminated due to zoning restrictions or unsuitability of the site 
for such a use. 
 
“As Vacant”: 
 
The subject is located south of Interstate 90 in southwest Billings with the primary 
surrounding improvements being industrial in nature. The immediate neighborhood is in 
the growth stage of its life cycle and there is steady, measured growth in the immediate 
area. The industrial market in Billings has been one of the strongest segments in this market 
for several years. Brokers are reporting a shortage of good quality light industrial 
properties, with continued strong demand for this property type. Additionally, there is a 
300,000 sf speculative light industrial property currently under development along South 
Frontage Road, approximately 6.5 miles east of the subject. This is the first speculative 
industrial development that this market has had in quite some time. This speaks to the 
increased demand for this property type.  
 
Given the current industrial market, the subject’s location with easy access to Interstate 90, 
and surrounding property types, I have concluded that if vacant, the highest and best use 
of the site is development with a light industrial building.

July 31, 2023 
 
     19      
“As Improved”: 
 
The subject is improved with a recently completed light industrial building that has 17% 
office area and 83% shop area. At just over 10,000 sf of main floor area, this is a size that 
is useable by a wide range of businesses in this market. The office finish is of good quality 
having a good mixture of conference, office, and support areas. The shop has a desirable 
sidewall height of 20’ and the three overhead doors provide good access to the shop. 
Additionally, there is 1,750 sf of mezzanine space that is partially finished and well suited 
for storage or future office space expansion. Furthermore, the large, secured graveled yard 
space is a highly desired amenity for this product type. Overall, the building has good curb 
appeal, and this configuration would suit the needs of a wide range of light industrial users.  
 
There is no question that the improvements add significantly to the overall value of the 
property and represent the highest and best use “as improved”.

COST APPROACH 
 
The Cost Approach is based upon the principle of substitution, which states a prudent 
investor would not pay more for a property than the amount required to purchase a similar 
site and construct similar improvements, without undue delay, to produce a property of 
equal desirability and utility. The procedure begins by estimating the land value of the 
subject site at its highest and best use, based upon a market analysis of recent comparable 
sales of vacant land similar to the subject site. The next step involves estimating the current 
replacement cost of the improvements, less accrued depreciation, if any. The final step 
involves adding the land value to the contributory value of the improvements to result in a 
final value indication. 
 
Land Valuation: 
 
Four sales have been gathered that are considered relevant in the valuation of the subject 
site. These sales differ from the subject in various ways, i.e. location, time of sale, and 
physical characteristics. The dissimilarities are adjusted for by adding to the price of the 
comparable when it is inferior to the subject, and conversely, subtracting from the price of 
the comparable when it is superior to the subject. In practice it is very difficult to isolate 
each factor and accurately assess the amount of adjustment required. In most areas there is 
simply not sufficient data; thus, an appraiser must use subjective judgment in analysis.  
 
A complete analysis of each sale is retained in my file. Pertinent data concerning these 
sales are contained in the following chart. The subject is listed on the left-hand side for 
comparison purposes.

 Market Conditions: These sales occurred between June, 2021 and May, 2023. The value 
of all classes of real property in this market increased measurably from mid-2020 to early-
2022. For this reason, I have adjusted Sales 3 and 4 by 10.0% to account for the 
improvement in market conditions. Sale 1 occurred in mid-2022 and Sale 2 in mid-2023. 
These sales are considered reflective of current conditions, therefore no adjustment is 
warranted. 
 
Property: Property adjustments analyzed for adjustment include location, utilities, zoning 
and size. Following is a discussion of each sale and its overall comparability to the subject.  
 
Discussion of Sales – Overall Comparability: 
 
Sale 1 is located in the West King Commercial Park Subdivision, which is located outside 
the city limits at the northwest corner of King Avenue West and South 64th Street West. 
These lots are to be serviced with a shared septic system and cistern. There is no zoning, 
however, there are strict CC&R’s in place which state the usage should be generally in 
compliance with the zoning classification “Controlled Industrial”. This site is currently 
being improved with a multi-tenant light industrial building. 
 
Although this sale has electricity, which is similar to the subject’s utilities, this site 
cannot be improved with a well and is to be serviced by a cistern. For this reason, I 
have concluded that this sale is inferior to the subject in utilities. Additionally, there 
is no zoning for this development, however, the CC&R’s that are in place are similar 
to the subject’s zoning. The intention behind these CC&R's is to govern land use and 
uphold property restrictions in a manner akin to how zoning regulations operate. 
Therefore, I have concluded that this sale is similar to the subject in zoning. 
Additionally, this sale is superior to the subject in size and inferior in location. This 
sale is inferior to the subject in overall comparability.

     23      
Sale 2 is the most recent sale of the subject. At the time of the sale there were no utilities 
available. The seller extended electricity to the site subsequent to the transaction.  
 
This sale is inferior to the subject in utilities and similar in location, zoning, and size. 
This sale is inferior to the subject in all elements of comparison.  
 
Sale 3 is located in the RF Development Properties Subdivision on the south side of 
Entryway Drive. This location is west of the subject, which is outside the city limits and 
will be serviced with well and septic. This location is in close proximity to Interstate 90 
with good accessibility. This site has been improved with a retail building.  
 
Given the proximity to Interstate 90, this sale is superior to the subject in location. 
Additionally, this sale is similar to the subject in utilities, zoning, and size. This sale is 
superior to the subject in overall comparability.  
 
Sale 4 is located in the same subdivision as the subject, Harnish Trade Center Subdivision, 
which is outside the city limits. This is in the latest phase of this subdivision, which consists 
of 38 industrial lots. The lot is located an earlier phase of the subdivision where gas & 
electricity were extended to the site at the time of sale. 
 
This sale is superior to the subject in size and similar in location, utilities, and zoning. This 
sale is superior to the subject in overall comparability. 
 
Conclusion of Value: 
 
The sales range from $3.60 to $5.68 psf after market conditions adjustments. These sales 
bracket the subject in overall comparability with two superior and two inferior. Given the 
superior location of Sale 3 and the superior size of Sale 4, the subject should command a

rate lower than $5.44 psf. Sales 1 and 2 are inferior to the subject in utilities. Additionally, 
Sale 1 is inferior in location. Based on these sales the subject should command a rate higher 
than $4.27 psf.   
 
Given this information, I have concluded to a market value of $4.85 psf. This is essentially 
the mid-point between the inferior Sale 1 and superior Sale 3. This is considered reasonable 
given the subject’s location, size, and utilities.  
 
The estimated market value of the subject site is calculated as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
66,832 sf   x   $4.85 psf   =   $324,135 
 
 
 
 
 
Improvement Valuation: 
 
The next step in this approach is estimating the cost new of improvements. The cost factors 
for the subject have been taken from two sources: 1) the recent cost estimate of a similar 
property in this market, and 1) Marshall Valuation Services (MVS), which is a cost data 
service providing average construction costs for a variety of improvement types and 
construction qualities with monthly updates of local and current cost multipliers. These cost 
factors are adjusted accordingly based on local conditions and the physical characteristics 
of the improvements.  
 
I have used a recent cost estimate of a light industrial property that is similar to the subject 
in both building and site improvements in the following analysis. This cost estimate has 
been completed by Eggart Engineering and Construction (EEC) and is dated May 2, 2023. 
The building is a 10,825 sf pre-engineered steel shop with approximately 29% office space. 
Total building costs are $1,219,471, which equates to $112.65 psf ($1,219,471 / 10,825 = 
$112.65). For analysis purposes, I have rounded this to $113.00 psf.

Additionally, the site improvements on the 46,478 sf lot consist of approximately 10,700 
sf of asphalt paving, 19,900 sf of graveled yard space, and similar landscaping. These costs 
total $193,074, which equates to $4.15 psf ($193,074 / 46,478 = $4.15). Applying these 
costs per square foot to the subject, the total cost of the building and site improvements is 
calculated as follows.  
 
Cost Breakdown 
 
 
 
Building:   10,200 sf  @ $113.00 psf 
= 
 $1,152,600 
 
 
Site Improvements: 66,832 sf @ $4.15 psf  = 
      277,353 
 
 
 
 
 
Total Cost: 
    
  =         $1,429,953     
 
 
Expressed on a per square foot basis, the total cost of the building and site improvements 
equates to $140.19 per square foot ($1,429,953 / 10,200 sf = $140.19 psf).  
 
The second source I have used to estimate cost is MVS. The cost factor from MVS is taken 
from Good Quality, Class “S” Industrials, Light Manufacturing (494), Section 14, Page 14 
and Good Quality Industrial, Interior Office Space (994), Section 14, Page 35. Starting 
with a base cost of $85.50 psf for the shop space and $113.00 psf for the office space the 
following chart shows the calculations and adjustments that go into arriving at the cost 
factor for the building.

*The cost of the site improvements is taken from the cost estimate of the comparable 
previously used. Trying to estimate the cost of site improvements via MVS is less than 
reliable. Using these cost estimates, the total cost of the building and site improvements 
via MVS is calculated as follows: 
 
MVS Cost Breakdown 
 
 
 
Shop: 
  8,450 sf  @ $127.27  
= 
$ 1,075,432 
 
 
Office: 
 1,750 sf @ $194.10   
= 
      339,675 
 
 
Site Improvements:       
 
 
= 
      277,353 
 
 
 
Total Cost via MVS: 
    =        $ 1,692,460    ($165.93 psf) 
 
As can be seen, the MVS estimate is 18.4% higher than the estimate derived via the cost 
comparable ($165.93 – $140.19 =  $25.74 / $140.19 = 0.184). At first glance this suggests 
that the cost estimate is slightly above market. It is my experience that national cost 
estimating services such as MVS almost always lag actual costs in smaller markets similar 
to Billings. Based on additional cost comparables retained in my files, the comparable’s 
estimated costs are reasonable and I have used this cost estimate in this analysis.

Based on the above information, the value of the subject property via the Cost Approach 
is calculated as follows. 
 
Cost Breakdown 
 
 
Building & Site Improvements: 
 
 
 
     =  $1,429,953

       = (              -) 
    
 Depreciated Value of Improvements:  
 
 
       = $1,429,953 
 
 
Plus Estimated Land Value: 
 
 
 
       =      324,135 
     
Total Estimated Value via Cost Approach: 
 
 
       = $1,754,088 
 
 
Rounded to:  
 
 
 
$1,755,000 
 
*Depreciation: 
 
The subject is recently constructed; therefore, no physical depreciation accrues to any of 
the components that make up replacement cost new (building and site). The layout of the 
building appears functional for its intended use, therefore, no depreciation is warranted for 
functional obsolescence. This leaves economic obsolescence as the final form to be 
considered. Economic obsolescence is a loss in value due to factors external to the property. 
So what factor external to the property could cause a loss in value? The short answer is the 
cost of construction. Is the market willing to pay the developer dollar for dollar based on 
the costs for a light industrial investment property? 
 
As will be shown in the Income Approach, the answer is yes. Based on Rental 2, which is 
nearly identical to the subject, lease rates are supporting costs. For this reason, I have 
concluded that there is no economic obsolescence.

SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
 
The value of a property tends to be set by the cost of acquiring an equally desirable 
substitute property. Therefore, in the Sales Comparison Approach market data obtained 
from sales of properties with a reasonable degree of similarity to the subject property are 
analyzed and adjusted to arrive at a value indication. The reliability and similarity of 
comparable sales data tends to determine the reliability and accuracy of this approach. 
Given the high variability between land value and improvement value among the 
comparable sales, I have valued these components separately. This eliminates the need for 
making adjustments to the sales for land value. The land value derived in the Cost 
Approach will be added as a line item in this approach.  
  
Improvement Valuation: 
 
Four sales that have a light industrial highest and best use have been gathered and used in 
the valuation of the building. On the following page is a data chart showing the pertinent 
facts for each sale along with its overall comparability to the subject. The unit of 
comparison is price per square foot of gross building area excluding land value. Complete 
descriptions of each sale are located in the addenda. Note to reader: The subject has an 
additional 1,750 sf of partially finished mezzanine storage. This additional square footage 
is not included in the total square footage as this is considered an additional amenity to the 
main floor.

Adjustments Made: 
 
Transactional: No adjustments were necessary to any of the sales for real property rights 
conveyed, financing terms or conditions of sale. 
 
Market Conditions: These sales occurred between October, 2021 and late-2023 (Pending 
Sale 1). The value of all classes of real property have increased measurably in this market 
from mid-2020 to early-2022. For this reason, I have adjusted Sale 4 by 10.0% to account 
for the improvement in market conditions. Sales 2 and 3 occurred in mid to late 2022 and 
Sale 1 is scheduled to close at completion of construction, estimated to be late-2023. These 
three sales are considered reflective of current conditions, therefore no adjustment is 
warranted. 
 
Property: Property adjustments consider elements such as location, physical 
characteristics, economic characteristics, legal characteristics, and non-realty components 
of value. I have analyzed these sales for the following six elements of comparability: 
location, effective age, size, % office area, quality/condition, and sidewall height. I have 
used qualitative analysis in this report. Following is a brief discussion of the sales and my 
assessment as to their overall comparability to the subject. 
 
Overall Comparability: 
 
Sale 1: Sale 1 is a pending sale that is scheduled to close in August, 2023. This sale is 
located in the West King Commercial Park Subdivision. This is a light industrial 
building that is currently under construction with two shop/office suites. Each unit 
has 1,975 sf of main floor shop space, 425 sf of main floor office space, and 415 
sf of mezzanine office (breakroom) for a total of 2,815 sf. The east unit has 
additional 485 sf of unfinished mezzanine space for storage. This square footage

has not been included in the total square footage. The site will have an asphalt 
paved parking lot and drive lanes. Additionally, there will be an asphalt paved 
yard that is secured by a chain link fence along the north side of the building. This 
was a purchase for speculative investment purposes. Although this sale was 
constructed for multiple occupants, I used it in this analysis due to the new 
construction component. 
 
  
This sale is superior to the subject in size and % of office area, inferior in location, 
quality/condition, and sidewall height and similar in effective age. This sale is 
inferior to the subject in overall comparability.    
 
Sale 2: Sale 2 is located in the same development as Sale 1, with the same master floor 
plan. The only difference between this sale and Sale 1 is the additional mezzanine 
office space and a graveled yard space rather than an asphalt paved yard. Similar 
to Sale 1, this sale is for multiple occupants and was used based on the new 
construction component.  
 
  
Similar to Sale 1, this sale is superior to the subject in size and % of office area, 
inferior in location, quality/condition, and sidewall height and similar in effective 
age. This sale is inferior to the subject in overall comparability.    
 
Sale 3: Sale 3 is also located in the same development as Sales 1 and 2, with the same 
master floor plan. This sale is similar to Sale 2 in size, however, there is additional 
unfinished mezzanine storage area. This additional square footage was not 
included in the total square footage as it is considered an additional amenity to the 
main floor. Similar to Sale 1, the rear yard space is asphalt paved. This sale was 
also constructed for multiple occupants and was used based on the new 
construction component.

     32      
  
Similar to Sales 1 and 2, this sale is superior to the subject in size and % of office 
area, inferior in location, quality/condition, and sidewall height and similar in 
effective age. This sale is inferior to the subject in overall comparability.    
 
Sale 4: Sale 4 is a newly constructed shop/warehouse building in the same development 
as the subject on Neihenke Avenue. The builder/seller in this sale is the same 
builder/seller of the subject. They had initially constructed this building for their 
own use but decided to sell it instead given the strength of the market. It was listed 
with NAI Business Properties and went under contract within 30 days. This is a 
good quality steel frame building that has 3,120 sf of good quality office on two 
levels. The warehouse has a 15’ finished ceiling height and is fully finished with 
taped and painted walls and ceilings. There are three 14’ x 14’ overhead doors, all 
ground level. Heat is suspended unit heaters. There is no exterior storage yard.  
 
  
This sale is superior to the subject in % of office area, inferior in sidewall height 
and similar in location, effective age, size, and quality/condition. This sale is 
similar to the subject in overall comparability. 
 
Summary & Conclusion of Value:    
 
 
 
The sales range from $113.86 psf to $137.13 psf after market conditions adjustments. Three 
are located in West King Commercial Park Subdivision, which is an inferior location to 
the subject. Additionally, each of these sales are superior to the subject in size and % of 
office area and inferior in location, quality/condition, and sidewall height. Based on these 
sales, the subject should command a rate higher than $130.20 psf. I have given these sales 
secondary consideration.

     33      
Primary consideration has been given to Sale 4. This sale is located in the same 
development as the subject and was built by the same builder. The superior % of office of 
this sale is counteracted by the inferior sidewall height. Based on this sale, the subject 
should command a rate similar to $137.13 psf.  
 
As previously mentioned, the subject is under contract for $1,750,000. This equates to 
$139.79 psf when land value is excluded, which is approximately $2.65 psf higher than 
Sale 4. This is approximately 1.9% higher than Sale 4, which is not substantial. Given the 
additional secured yard space and partially finished mezzanine of the subject, it is 
reasonable for the subject to be slightly higher than Sale 4. Based on this information, I 
have concluded that the pending sales price is reflective of market value. 
 
The market value of the subject via the Sales Comparison Approach is calculated as 
follows: 
 
Building: 
10,200 sf   x   $139.79/sf 
= 
$1,425,858 
Plus Land Value: 
  
 
= 
     324,135 
 
 
Overall Market Value: 
= 
$1,749,993 
 
 
 
Rounded to:  
 
 
$1,750,000

INCOME APPROACH 
 
The Income Approach is an appraisal technique that translates anticipated or future benefits 
from a property into an indication of value. This technique is predicated on the assumption 
that, under typical conditions, a prudent investor would not pay more for a property than 
they would for an alternative investment that offered comparable financial return 
characteristics. Having its origin in financial analysis, this approach arrives at a value 
indication by: 
 
1)   
Projecting the future net income that could be generated by a property under a 
hypothetical efficient operation, assuming the property is well managed, well 
maintained and well marketed at current market rates; and  
 
2)   
Capitalizing or discounting net income to an indication of present value at a rate that 
reflects existing market reactions to it. 
 
The estimated gross income is typically derived through an analysis of the subject’s past 
rental history and by conducting a rental survey of similar properties. The subject is 
recently constructed and is being purchased for owner occupancy, therefore, there is no 
rental history or lease agreement to help guide an estimate of market rent.  
 
My estimate of market rent is based on a rental survey of similar sized, good quality  
office/shop properties located in west Billings. The chart on the following page shows the 
pertinent information for each comparable.

Discussion - Estimate of Market Rent: 
 
The rental rates for these properties range from $8.91 to $12.89 psf (NNN). All are good 
to very good quality shop/warehouse buildings with average to good quality office space. 
Rental 1 is inferior to the subject in % office area. Rental 2 is located west of the subject 
on Entryway Drive. This sf does not include the additional mezzanine storage area. This 
building is nearly identical to the subject and was constructed by the same builder. This 
comparable is similar to the subject in all elements of comparison. Rental 3 is superior to 
the subject in location and % office area and inferior in size. Rental 4 is similar to the 
subject in all elements of comparison. Rental 5 is inferior to the subject in location, size 
and % of office area.

July 31, 2023 
 
     36      
Based on these comparables, the subject should command a rate higher than $9.75 psf and 
similar to $10.07 psf to $12.89 psf. Giving this information, I have estimated market rent 
for the subject to be $11.50 psf. This is considered reasonable given the subject’s sidewall 
height, brand new construction, and secured storage yard.   
 
 
 
 
 
10,200 sf @ $11.50 psf  
=   $117,300 
 
Vacancy & Collection Loss: 
 
There is very little vacancy among good quality light industrial buildings in this market. 
Demand is strong and supply is limited. Given the ever-increasing costs of construction, 
supply is not anticipated to exceed demand any time in the near future. Under that scenario, 
it is unlikely any good quality building would remain vacant for an extended period of time 
if priced at market. I have estimated the vacancy rate to be 5.0%, which is a typical rate for 
this market.  
 
Operating Expenses: 
 
The next item to examine is the landlord's expenses. Market rent is based on the tenant 
paying all expenses except structural maintenance and repair, which is often referred to as 
a NNN lease. I have estimated this expense to be 2.5% of effective gross income. This can 
also be thought of as a reserve for repairs expense, which is an amount set aside each year 
to cover periodic repairs/replacement of long-lived items such as mechanical systems, roof 
coverings, and asphalt paving.

Based on these income and expense figures, net operating income is calculated as follows:

      Net Operating Income

Direct Capitalization: 
 
In order to convert the subject's net operating income into a value estimate, it is necessary 
to divide it by the proper capitalization rate. The cap rates exhibited by the sales are as 
follows: 6.18%, 6.54%, 6.64%, and 6.03% respectively, with an overall average of 6.35%.  
 
A cap rate is nothing more than a measurement of risk. The higher the perceived risk 
associated with the investment the higher the rate. The subject would be perceived as 
having average risk for this market. The subject is new construction with an ideal ratio of 
shop to office space in a growing industrial development. Additionally, this property type 
has been well received in the immediate area, which has experienced a continued increase 
in demand. Given the subject’s 20’ sidewall height, new construction, and fully secured 
yard area, the subject would be viewed as a desirable investment in this market. Placing 
primary emphasis on the overall average, I have estimated a market rate of 6.35%.

To arrive at market value via the Income Approach, the net operating income is divided by 
the cap rate, as follows:

CORRELATION ANALYSIS 
 
AND 
 
FINAL VALUE ESTIMATE 
 
The three approaches indicate the following value estimates for the subject property: 
 
COST APPROACH  
 
 
$1,755,000 
SALES COMPARISON APPROACH  
$1,750,000 
INCOME APPROACH 
 
 
$1,710,000 
 
The Cost Approach and the Sales Comparison Approach arrive at similar values and have 
been given primary consideration. The Cost Approach is an excellent indicator of value for 
newly constructed buildings that represent the highest and best use of the property. The 
subject is being purchased for owner occupancy and this type of buyer is keenly aware of 
construction costs, as this is the alternative to purchasing an existing building. The Sales 
Comparison Approach is the method of valuation used by an owner occupant. In addition 
to the cost of construction, an owner-occupant is also judging the subject against other 
buildings having similar utility. These two approaches provide excellent support for the 
subject’s pending sales price.  
 
The Income Approach is the method most often used by investors. The value via this 
approach is based on the properties income generating potential. As the cost of construction 
continues to increase, and the cost to borrow money has doubled over the past two years, 
this approach is no longer as relevant as the other two approaches for an owner-occupied 
property. For this reason, the Income Approach has been given secondary consideration.

July 31, 2023 
 
     40      
As previously mentioned, the subject is currently under contract for $1,750,000 and this 
price is well supported by the Cost Approach and the Sales Comparison Approach. Based 
on the analysis of the date and information presented in this report, I have concluded that 
the pending sales price is reflective of market value.  
 
The “As Is” market value of the fee simple estate, as of the date of last inspection, July 28, 
2023, is:  
 
 
One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars 
 
($1,750,000) 
 
For the purposes of this analysis, a reasonable exposure period is estimated to be less than 
6 months. This is based on a review of sales activity for similar types of property and 
assumes competitive pricing and competent marketing procedures.

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS 
This Appraisal Report, the Letter of Transmittal and the Certification of Value are made expressly 
subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions, and any special limiting conditions 
contained in the report which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
1. 
The legal description furnished is assumed to be correct. I assume no responsibility for 
matters legal in character nor do I render any opinion as to the Title, which is assumed to 
be good.  All existing liens and encumbrances, if any, have been disregarded, and the 
property is appraised as though free and clear, under responsible ownership and competent 
management. 
 
2. 
The sketch in this report is included to assist the reader in visualizing the property.  I have 
made no survey of the property and assume no responsibility in connection with such 
matters. 
 
3. 
No responsibility is assumed for accuracy of information furnished by work of others, the 
client, his designee or public records. I am not liable for such information, nor the work of 
possible subcontractors. The comparable data relied upon in this report has been confirmed 
with one or more parties familiar with the transaction or from affidavit or other source 
thought reasonable; all are considered appropriate for inclusion to the best of my factual 
judgment and knowledge. An impractical and uneconomic expenditure of time would be 
required in attempting to furnish unimpeachable verification in all instances, particularly 
as to engineering and market-related information. It is suggested that the client consider 
independent verification as a prerequisite to any transaction involving, sale, lease or other 
significant commitment of funds or subject property. 
 
4. 
This appraisal has been prepared for the exclusive benefit of the client. It may not be used 
or relied upon by any other party. Any party who uses or relies upon any information in 
this report, without the preparer's written consent, does so at his own risk. Possession of 
this report, or a copy thereof, does not carry with it the right of publication, nor may it be 
used for any purpose by any but the applicant without the previous written consent of the 
appraiser or the applicant, and then only with proper qualification. 
 
5. 
The contract for appraisal, consultation or analytical service is fulfilled and the total fee 
payable upon completion of the report. The appraiser or those assisting in preparation of 
the report will not be asked or required to give testimony in court or hearing because of 
having made the appraisal, in full or in part, nor engage in post appraisal consultation with 
client or third parties except under separate and special arrangement and at additional fee. 
If testimony or deposition is required because of any subpoena, the client shall be 
responsible for any additional time, fees and charges regardless of issuing party.  
 
 
6. 
The distribution of the total valuation of this report between land and improvements applies 
only under the existing program of utilization. The separate valuations for land and 
building must not be used in conjunction with any other appraisal, and are invalid if so 
used.

7. 
Subsurface rights (minerals and oils) were not considered in making this appraisal. 
 
8. 
This appraiser very carefully inspected the building involved in this Appraisal Report. No 
advice is given regarding mechanical equipment or structural integrity or adequacy, nor 
soils and potential for settlement, drainage, and such (seek assistance from qualified 
architect and/or engineer), nor matters concerning liens, title status, legal marketability 
(seek legal assistance), and such. The lender and owner should inspect the property before 
any disbursement of funds; further, it is likely that the lender or owner may wish to require 
mechanical or structural inspections by qualified and licensed contractors, civil or 
structural engineers, architects, or other experts.  
 
 
9. 
The appraiser has inspected as far as possible by observation, the land and the 
improvements; however, it was not possible to personally observe conditions beneath the 
soil or hidden structural or other components. I have not critically inspected mechanical 
components within the improvements and no representations are made herein as to these 
matters unless specifically stated and considered in the report. The value estimate is 
predicated on the assumption that there is no such material on or in the property that would 
cause a loss in value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for any 
expertise or engineering knowledge required to discover them.  The client is urged to retain 
an expert in this field, if desired. 
 
10. 
The appraisal is based on there being no hidden, unapparent, or apparent conditions of the 
property site, subsoil or structures, nor toxic materials which would render it more or less 
valuable. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, nor for any expertise or 
engineering required to discover them. All mechanical components are assumed to be in 
operation condition and status standard for properties of the subject type. Conditions of 
heating, cooling, ventilating, electrical and plumbing equipment are considered to be 
commensurate with the condition of the balance of the improvements unless otherwise 
stated. No judgment may be made by the appraiser as to adequacy of insulation, type of 
insulation or energy efficiency of the improvements or equipment which is assumed 
standard for subject age and type.  
 
11. 
All furnishings and equipment, except those specifically indicated and typically considered 
as a part of real estate, have been disregarded by this appraiser. Only the real estate has 
been considered. 
 
12. 
The comparable sales data relied upon in this appraisal is believed to be from reliable 
sources; however, it was not possible to inspect the comparables completely, and it was 
necessary to rely on information furnished by others as to said data; therefore, the value 
conclusions are subject to the correctness and verification of said data. 
 
13. 
The appraiser assumes no responsibility for any costs or consequences arising from the 
need or lack of need for flood hazard insurance. An Agent for the Federal Flood Insurance 
Program should be contacted to determine the actual need for Flood Hazard Insurance.

14. 
Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report shall be conveyed to any person or 
entity other than the appraiser's or firm's client, through advertising, solicitation materials, 
public relations, news, sales, or other media without the written consent and approval of 
the authors, particularly as to valuation conclusions, the identity of the appraiser or firm 
with which the appraiser is connected, or any reference to the Appraisal Institute. Further, 
the appraiser or firm assumes no obligation, liability, or accountability to any third party. 
If this report is placed in the hands of anyone but the client, the client shall make such party 
aware of all the assumptions and limiting conditions of the assignment.  
 
15. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective January 26, 1992. I have not 
made a specific compliance survey and analysis of this property to determine whether or 
not it is in conformity with the various detailed requirements of the ADA. It is possible that 
a compliance survey of the property together with a detailed analysis of the requirements 
of the ADA could reveal that the property is not in compliance with one or more of the 
requirements of the act. If so, this fact could have a negative effect upon the value of the 
property. Since I have no direct evidence relating to this issue, I did not consider possible 
noncompliance with the requirements of ADA in estimating the value of the property. 
 
16. 
The appraisal is based on the premise that there is full compliance with all applicable 
federal, state and local environmental regulations and laws unless otherwise stated in this 
report; further that all applicable zoning, building and use regulations and restrictions of 
all types have been complied with unless otherwise stated in the report. Furthermore, it is 
assumed that all required licenses, consents, permits, or other legislative or administrative 
authority, local, state, federal and/or private entity or organization have been or can be 
obtained or renewed for any use considered in the value estimate. 
  
17. 
The appraiser reserves the right to re-evaluate statements, analysis, conclusions or any 
value estimate in the appraisal if facts become known that are pertinent to the appraisal 
process and which were unknown when the report was finished. 
 
18. 
If this report is placed in the hands of anyone other than the client, the client shall make 
such party aware of all limiting conditions and assumptions of the assignment and related 
discussions.  The appraiser assumes no responsibility for any costs incurred to discover or 
correct any deficiencies of any type present in the property; physically, financially, 
economically or legally. 
 
 
ACCEPTANCE OF, AND/OR USE OF THIS APPRAISAL REPORT BY THE CLIENT 
OR ANY THIRD PARTY CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE ABOVE 
CONDITIONS.

Comments: 
The seller is a local general contractor who initially constructed the building for owner occupancy, 
however, due to the increase in demand for this property type in the market the seller decided to list the 
property for sale as it neared completion. The property was initially listed for sale by owner. After a 
couple weeks of no interest the property was listed by Matt Robertson with NAI and the went under 
contract within 10 days of this listing. The buyer purchased the building for owner occupancy.

Comments: 
Site: This property is located in southwest Billings, immediately south of the Interstate 90/Zoo Drive 
interchange. The immediate area has been developed with good quality shop/warehouse buildings with 
associated office areas on 1 to 3 acre lots. This is a desirable area for light industrial properties given its 
proximity to the interstate, newer infrastructure, and lower taxes and utility costs due to being located in 
the county. The improvements are located on Lot 3. Lots 7 & 8 are unimproved and considered to be 
excess land. The contributory value of these lots is estimated to be $453,356 ($3.60/sf), which leaves 
$1,296,644 to Lot 3 and the improvements.   
 
Building: The building is located on Lot 3, which fronts Niehenke Ave. Lots 7 and 8 are adjacent to the 
south and front Entryway Drive. These two lots are vacant and excess land in this transaction. The site 
coverage ratio is based on Lot 3 site area only. The contributory value of Lots 7 & 8 is estimated to be 
$453,356 ($3.60/sf). This is a good quality pre-engineered steel building that features a heated shop with 
15’ sidewalls, (3) 14’ x 14’ overhead doors, concrete floors and painted drywall ceilings and walls. There 
is 3,120 sf (36%) of good quality office space on two levels that feature LVP flooring, acoustic tile 
ceilings, painted drywall, painted wood trim and a neutral clean aesthetic. The exterior is maintenance 
free steel with a standing seam metal roof. Along the main floor office space is a covered concrete patio

with wood beams. The site is partially improved with a gravel parking lot. There is no secured yard, 
however the size of the lot is certainly sufficient for one.

Engagement Letter
Furthermore, this indemnification provision in this paragraph shall not apply to appraisals performed in
Vermont; for other states, in the event that the indemnification provision in this paragraph is broader than
permitted by any applicable law or regulation, this section shall be limited to the extent of the indemnification
permitted by such law or regulation in that state.
g.      Termination
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, either Financial Institution or MountainSeed may,
at its option and for any reason, terminate this agreement without responsibility for payment of the
appraiser's fees or costs, except for any actual staff time and out−of−pocket costs only, not to exceed the
fee amount stated above, incurred by the appraiser in connection with the appraiser's performance of this
agreement as of the date of termination.
h.      Amendment
This Engagement Letter may only be amended in writing, signed by the parties hereto.
i.        Confidentiality
You will take all reasonable steps to ensure that neither you nor any organization with which you are
affiliated (including any employees, agents, appraisers, or officers of any such organization) will divulge any
Confidential Information concerning your Appraisal to any person other than Financial Institution or
MountainSeed.  For purposes of this engagement letter, the term Confidential Information shall mean all
non−public data or information that is submitted directly or indirectly to you by MountainSeed or Financial
Institution or obtained or learned by you as a result of the engagement described in this Letter, including
without limitation, information related to Financial Institutions or MountainSeeds customers, technology,
operations facilities, consumer markets, products, capabilities, systems procedures, security practices,
research, development, business affairs, ideas, concepts, innovations, inventions, designs, business
methodologies, improvements, trade secrets, copyrightable subject matter and other proprietary information.
 All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Financial Institution or MountainSeed, as
applicable, and shall be protected as described below.
Except may be required by applicable law or lawful order or requirement of a court or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction over you, you shall take reasonable means to hold all Confidential Information in
confidence, and you shall not use (except for purposes set forth herein and authorized by Financial
Institution or MountainSeed), disclose, duplicate, publish, release, transfer or otherwise make available
Confidential Information in any form to, or for the use and benefit of, any person or entity without the
express written consent of MountainSeed.  You represent and warrant to Financial Institution and
MountainSeed that you have established commercially reasonable controls to ensure the confidentiality of
Confidential Information and to insure that Confidential Information is not disclosed in violation of the
provisions of this Engagement Letter or the Gramm−Leach−Bliley Act of 1999 (15 U.S.C. § 6801, et seq.),
as it may be amended, supplemented or replaced from time to time (the GLB Act) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. If the GLB Act, the regulations promulgated thereunder or other applicable law
now or hereafter in effect imposes a higher standard of confidentiality, such standard shall prevail over the
standard set forth in this Engagement Letter.
You also agree that you will at any time during your engagement, at MountainSeeds or Financial Institutions
request, and in any event, at the termination of this engagement, regardless of the reason, surrender to
MountainSeed and/or Financial Institution (as is appropriate) all Confidential Information and any copies or
abstracts thereof, to the extent surrendering the information is not prohibited under USPAP or other
applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and guidelines that may require you
to maintain certain records.
You have caused this Engagement Letter to be executed as of the date set forth below.
