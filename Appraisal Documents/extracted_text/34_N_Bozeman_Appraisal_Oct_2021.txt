ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS 
 
This appraisal report, the letter of transmittal, and certification are subject to the following assumptions 
and limiting conditions; and also, any special qualifying conditions that may be contained elsewhere in 
the report are incorporated by reference. 
 
Assumptions 
 
1. That the legal description, as furnished, is correct; and that the title to the property is good and 
marketable. All existing liens and encumbrances, if any, have been disregarded. The property is 
appraised as though free and clear of other burdens, under responsible ownership and competent 
management. 
 
2. That the land dimensions taken from available maps, plats, and/or surveys are correct. It has been 
assumed that those boundaries that are apparent are correct. 
 
3. It is assumed that the use of the land and improvements is confined within the boundaries or property 
lines of the property described and that there is no encroachment or trespass unless noted in the 
report. 
 
4. That no adverse water table or soil conditions exist, and no representation regarding such conditions 
is made in this report unless specifically stated; and, that the value estimated is predicated on the 
absence of any such conditions occurring. 
 
5. It is assumed that the subject property conforms to all applicable zoning and use regulations and 
restrictions unless nonconformity has been identified, described and considered in the appraisal 
report. 
 
6. Those opinions, estimates, data and statistics supplied by others in the course of this study, are 
correct; the assumption has been made that the sources are reliable, but no responsibility has been 
inferred for their accuracy.

                                                  Bridger Appraisals Inc. ©                                                                        8

7.
This report does not contemplate any court action, nor does it obligate the appraiser to give any 
testimony or make any appearance in court, before commission, arbitrator or any other individual, 
body or agency. If court action or appearance later becomes necessary in the interest of the client, the 
terms of the additional service shall be negotiated at that time. 
 
8. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the appraiser did not observe the existence of hazardous 
material, which may or may not be present on the property. I have no knowledge of the existence of 
such materials on or in the property. I am not qualified to detect such substances. The presence of 
potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. This extends to any leaks from 
underground fuel storage tanks, and identification of Asbestos containing materials. The value 
estimate is predicated on the assumption that there is no such material on or in the property. No 
responsibility is assumed for any such conditions or for any expertise or engineering knowledge 
required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field, if desired. Any such 
environmental risk discovered at a later date may require a revised estimate of value that may or may 
not be simply a reduction of the value by the estimated cost to cure the environmental condition. 
Properties known to have environmental risk may also carry a stigma in the market place that may or 
may not affect the value. If future soil tests should reveal the existence of any such soil conditions or 
hazardous waste, I reserve the right to review and adjust this appraisal accordingly. 
 
Limiting Conditions: 
 
1. The appraiser is not responsible for any matter legal in character, nor is any opinion rendered as to 
title, which is assumed to be marketable. 
 
2. The value reflected in the analysis applies only to the program of utilization considered in this report. 
The use of the value in conjunction with any other appraisal or under other influences invalidates the 
conclusions developed. 
 
3. This analysis and estimate of value is made for the exclusive use and benefit of the clients to whom it 
is addressed; and, possession of this report or a copy, does not carry with it the right of publication, 
nor may it be used for any purpose other than that intended without the previous consent of the 
appraisers. In any event, only the entire report may be used and no part shall be taken or used out of 
context.

Included as an integral part of this report are maps and photographs of the appraised property and 
sales. The maps and photographs were prepared and taken by the appraisers, and although they do not 
purport to represent survey accuracy, they are substantially correct and adequately serve as visual 
reference to the property. 
 
5. Disclosure of the contents of this report is governed by the By-Laws and Regulations of the Appraisal 
Institute. Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report (especially any conclusions of value, 
the identity of the appraisers or the firm with which they are connected) shall be disseminated to the 
public through advertising media, public relations, news media, sales media, or any other public 
means of communication without the prior written consent and approval of the authors. 
 
6. The forecasts, projections, or operating estimates contained herein are based on current market 
conditions, anticipated short-term supply and demand factors, and a continued stable economy.  
These forecasts are, therefore, subject to changes with future conditions.  
 
7. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective January 26, 1992.  The appraiser has 
not made a specific compliance survey or analysis of the property to determine whether or not it is in 
conformity with the various detailed requirements of ADA.  It is possible that a compliance survey of 
the property and a detailed analysis of the requirements of the ADA would reveal that the property is 
not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of the act.  If so, this fact could have a 
negative impact upon the value of the property.  Since the appraiser has no direct evidence relating to 
this issue, possible noncompliance with the requirements of ADA was not considered in estimating 
the value of the subject property.  
 
8. 
 conclusion of value is based upon the assumption that there are no hidden or 
unapparent conditions of the properties that might impact upon build ability.  The appraiser 
recommends due diligence be conducted through local building departments or municipality to 
investigate build ability and whether the properties are suitable for their intended use. The appraiser 
makes no representations, guarantees or warranties.

values have been increasing. 
 
 
Obviously, the world was exposed to COVID-19 and the 
effects to the Bozeman market began the week of March

Reilly, MAI 
SCOPE OF THE APPRAISAL 
 
The scope of work consists of the amount and type of information researched and analyzed in an 
assignment.  
 
In preparing the appraisal, I have personally viewed the subject site and improvements and 
considered pertinent characteristics of the site and improvements in comparison to current 
market standards. I have analyzed the subject neighborhood and competing markets for current 
sales data.  
 
Local commercial real estate agents and brokers were consulted with to confirm sales 
information. 
 
I viewed the exterior of the subject on October 12, 2021. I have previously viewed the interior 
and exterior of the subject on October 14, 2020. I have no reason to believe the interior of the 
building is in any different condition on October 12, 2021 as it was on October 14, 2020. The 
scope of the inspection included observation of readily observable conditions and is not 
equivalent to a building inspection. The subject property was personally measured by the 
appraiser on October 14, 2020. The viewing did not include operating or testing of the electrical 
system, plumbing, or HVAC.  
 
General and specific data was obtained through personal and telephone interviews with 
government officials, property managers, developers, and other market participants. I have 
considered the highest and best use of the property as if vacant and as improved, and have 
applied the sales comparison approach valuation method. The income approach and the cost 
approach are not applicable to valuing the subject property. The improvements are older and 
suffer a considerable amount of depreciation, making the cost approach unreliable. The most 
probable purchaser is a real estate developer. The subject would not be purchased for a current 
income stream; thus, the income approach is not applicable.  The results indicated by this method 
has been reviewed and reconciled based on the reliability, relevance and reasonableness of the 
data, and the purpose and intended user of the appraisal.   
 
This is an Appraisal Report as defined by Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 
under Standards Rule 2-2. This format provides a summary of the appraisal process, subject and 
market data and valuation analyses. The information contained in this report is specific to the 
needs of the client and for the intended use as stated in this report.

PURPOSE AND INTENDED USE AND USER OF THE APPRAISAL 
 
The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate a credible opinion of the Current Market Value of the 
sub
Fee Simple Inte
As 
 as of October 12, 2021, in accordance with the 
Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and supplemented by the 
Appraisal Institute. The intended use of the appraisal is to assist the Client and Intended User, 
City of Bozeman, in determining the current market value for possible sale purposes. There are 
no other intended users of this appraisal report. Insurable value has not been estimated. 
 
DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE    
 
Market value is defined as the most probable price, which a property should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, 
each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue 
stimulus.  Implicit in this definition is consummation of a sale as of a specified date and passing 
of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 
 
1. Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
2. Both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what they consider their 
own best interest; 
3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
4. Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements 
comparable thereto; 
5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or 
creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 1

PROPERTY RIGHTS APPRAISED 
 
Property rights are ownership interests in real estate and have value.  It is important to know 
what property right(s) or estate(s) are involved in the appraisal, because the estate identifies the

EXPOSURE TIME 
 
Exposure time should not be confused with the marketing period. Exposure time precedes the 
effective date of the appraisal. In other words, how long the subject property would be actively 
marketed prior to the effective date of the appraisal to bring the estimated opinion of market 
value determined in the appraisal.  Marketing time is the period after the effective date of the 
appraisal.  In other words, how long would it take to sell the subject property, at the appraised 
market value, after the effective date of the appraisal? Typically, in a stable market the marketing 
time and exposure time should be relatively similar. 
 
Current sales in the Bozeman market have been relied upon to estimate the exposure time of the 
subject property.  Due to the size of the market, the best estimate for exposure time is derived 
from sales of similar type property.  
 
Based upon the current market conditions, sales data within the report and current listings, I have 
estimated the exposure time for the subject property to be 1-6 months.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VALUATION DATE 
 
The effective date of the appraisal is October 12, 2021. This is the date of valuation and the date 
that the subject property was personally viewed.

REGIONAL, CITY, AND NEIGHBORHOOD ANALYSIS 
 
The purpose of this section is to identify the pertinent social, economic, governmental and 
environmental factors that affect property value and to analyze their impact on the appraised 
 current market value.  This analysis begins with regional information and moves to 
relevant information about the city and the Subj
. A neighborhood is defined 
as a grouping of similar land uses.  From an appraisal viewpoint, this is the area where the 
subject property competes with other properties and where the most comparable market data is 
obtained.   
 
 Bozeman, Montana is located in Gallatin County, in an area more commonly referred to as the 
Gallatin Valley. Gallatin County covers 2,632 square miles of mountainous lands varying in 
topography and climate which are located in the southwestern part of the state, more specifically 
between Park and Madison counties, north of the Montana-Wyoming border and Yellowstone 
National Park.  Gallatin County is known for downhill skiing opportunities at Big Sky Resort, 
Moonlight Basin, and Bridger Bowl.  In addition to world-class skiing, Gallatin County plays 
host to a multitude of other outdoor activities, as half of the land in the county is under public 
ownership by the Gallatin National Forest, State of Montana, Bureau of Land Management, or 
the National Park Service. In the past decade, Gallatin County has grown faster than any other 
county in the state of Montana, with the largest population increase in the state between the 2010 
Census and the 2020 Census 
Missoula 
County in 2020 to become the second largest in the state with an estimated population of 
118,960 in 2020. Bozeman, the county seat for Gallatin County, is located approximately 140 
miles to the west of Billings, Montana and 65 miles to the north of Yellowstone National Park. 
With an estimated population of 53,293 in the 2020 Census, Bozeman has been the fourth largest 
city in Montana since 2004.  
 
Social Factors: 
 
Social influences that affect value include, but are not limited to, population characteristics such 
as growth, population density, age distribution, household sizes, employment status, availability 
of education and the quality of life. 
 
Historic and Recent Population Trends - City of Bozeman, Gallatin County and Montana: 
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the City of Bozeman's population increased from 37,280 
in 2010 to 53,293 in 2020, which indicates an approximate 42.95% overall increase or 4.29% 
annual increase over that ten-
wth rate 
between 1980 and 1990 was about 0.47% per year. In the past decade, Gallatin County and 
Bozeman have grown faster than any other county or city in the state according to U.S. Census 
Bureau data.  
 
Gallatin County's population increased from 67,831 in 2000 to 89,513 in 2010, then to 118,960 
in 2020, which indicates an increase in total of 51,129. This represents an increase in population 
of 75.37% over a 20 year period and of approximately 32.89% over a ten-year period. In 2018,

Reilly, MAI 
Gallatin County earned the number one rank as the largest  gaining micropolitan area (numeric 
increase) for the second year in a row.  The entire state of Montana grew by 9.7% to 989,415 
residents between 2000 and 2010, adding 87,220 people over that ten-year period. From 2010 to 
2020, the state gained 94,810 people, to a total estimated population of 1,084,225, indicating an 
increase of 9.58%.  Montana is ranked 44th of the states in population. 
 
 
In addition to population growth, the City of Bozeman continues to grow in geographic size. In 
order to accommodate the increasing population and business growth, new land for residential, 
commercial and industrial development has been annexed into the City.  In 1990, the City was 
approximately 6,420 acres (10 square miles) in size. By the end of 2009, the City of Bozeman 
was approximately 12,319 acres (19.25 square miles) in size resulting in a 91 percent increase in 
size over a period of 19 years. From 2009 to 2017, an additional 529.33 acres were annexed into 
the City, and from 2018 to 2020, 433.21 acres were annexed into the City.  The City has a 
reserve of developable land within its current boundaries. 
Bozeman is characterized by a smaller portion of families and an average household size 
somewhat smaller than Gallatin County as a whole. Bozeman has an average household size of 
2.20 people, while the average household size for Gallatin county is 2.37 people and 
countrywide is 2.62 people per household. Bozeman also exhibits a significantly lower 
homeownership rate than the county as a whole; primarily due to the student body of Montana 
State University.  
  
In general, the City of Bozeman has a significantly higher educational attainment level than 
Gallatin County or Montana. Approximately 58.7% of Bozeman residents ages 25 and older 
have a college degree, compared to 50.1% for Gallatin County and 32.0% for the State of 
Montana.   Greatschools.net rated the majority of Bozeman public schools with 8 or higher out of 
a possible 10, using standardized test scores and national scoring to rate. 
 
Bozeman and Gallatin County have transformed over the past decade from a primarily 
agricultural-based community to a tourism related community and technology trade. The appeal 
of Bozeman and the Gallatin County area has been due to the high quality of life that this area 
offers.  Low crime rates, cultural experiences and abundant outdoor activities add to the quality 
of life for residents. World-class snow skiing, blue ribbon rivers and streams for fishing, and

miles of protected trails and lands for hiking, biking and camping are some of the most 
commonly appreciated attributes of the area. 
 
Economic Factors: 
 
Economically speaking, Bozeman historically has been somewhat different than the rest of the 
State of Montana and the nation as a whole. One of the primary reasons for this difference is the 
circumstance that there are not a large number of employers who employ a significant amount of 
the population. For example, other areas of Montana such as Missoula are very dependent on the 
specific industries such as the lumber industry. When the lumber industry slowed, Missoula was 
severely affected by the impact. In contrast, the primary employer in Bozeman is Montana State 
University which is very stable. 
 
The economy of Bozeman and Gallatin County is both broad based and diverse, with over 5,000 
establishments that employ over 42,000 people. Major sectors of the economy include industries 
in the areas of construction, government, manufacturing, technology, retail service and 
agriculture which all play significant roles. The largest single employer in the area is Montana 
State University (MSU) that employs over 3,800 people as permanent faculty/staff and graduate 
teaching/research assistants. MSU also employs over 2,000 students in part-time jobs. In the fall 
of 2020, the enrollment at MSU was 16,249 students. The student body of MSU has a significant 
effect on the local economy. Other significant employers in the county include the State of 
Montana, Gallatin County, the City of Bozeman, Bozeman Deaconess Hospital, Oracle 
Technologies, and Wal-
s employment base continues to diversify, the local 
economic health is expected to be buffered from a downturn in an
industries.  If current trends continue even at a moderate pace, Gallatin County will grow by 
nearly 50,000 people from 2019 through 2045 with about half of the growth likely to occur in the 
City of Bozeman.

Economic Development:  
 
The North 19th Avenue corridor remains as a significant area of commercial real estate 
development in Bozeman. As of 2021, Starbucks, Town Pump, Comfort Inn & Suites, TJ Maxx, 
U-Swirl, Cost Cutters, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Sleep Number, Auto Zone, CVS, My Place 
Hotel, and Taco Bell have been added to the North 19th Avenue area. Furthermore, Costco is in 
the process of completing an expansion of its existing facility at the northern end of the North 
19th Avenue corridor. A notable development on the North 19th Avenue corridor is a WinCo 
Foods grocery store that opened in early 2021 in the Gallatin Center Subdivision. This store has 
an approximate gross building area of 75,000 square feet with approximately 36,500 square feet 
of additional building area planned for future phases. There is also a new car wash facility that is 
under construction on Burke Street in the Gallatin Center Subdivision. 
 The Bozeman Gateway mixed-use development, located on West Main Street near College 
Street, has several newer buildings including a 55,363 square foot Kohls department store, 
Rosauers Su
-tenant mixed-use 
buildings, numerous restaurants, and miscellaneous commercial buildings. The Bozeman 
Gateway mixed-use developments is projected to add numerous additional commercial and 
mixed-use buildings to the development in the near future. In Fall 2020, Gallatin Valley Mall

announced that Whole Foods will be coming to Bozeman. This will be the first Whole Foods in 
the state and completion is expected for Fall 2021. This is phase one of a redevelopment plan for 
the Gallatin Valley Mall. Further to the west on Huffine Lane, the Ferguson Farm commercial 
development has added multiple new restaurants, a brewery, and office space. A Town and 
Country grocery store is planned for the Ferguson Farm development which will have an 
approximate gross building area of 38,378 square feet when it is complete. 
At the Montana State University, campus construction finished the $10 million football stadium 
expansion and construction has begun on the Bobcat Athletic Complex, a 40,000sf facility 
housing locker rooms, team rooms, sports medicine, and training and rehabilitation spaces for 
student athletes. The facility is expected to open in August 2021. Other developments to 
Montana State University included a new Molecular Biology Center, Health and Physical 
Education Center, Black Box Theater, Marsh Laboratory, biology building, Gaines Hall 
renovation, new USDA Research Building and Teaching Facility, Yellowstone and Hyalite Halls 
(dormitories), and the new College of Business building. A $12.5 million parking garage opened 
in January 2017 and the $70 million Norm Asbjornson Hall (110,000 square foot building) was 
completed in December of 
departments.  
 
Significant developments to the City of Bozeman over the past ten years have included an 
addition to Fire Station No. 1, police station, additions to the water/wastewater treatment plants, 
additions to city hall, the completion of the Downtown Parking Garage, the construction of the 
Fire Station No. 3 and Gallatin County 911 Dispatch Center in Bozeman, a new water 
reclamation facility, renovation of the old City of Bozeman Library into the new City Hall, the 
construction of the Gallatin County Detention Center, and both expansions of the landfill 
building located at the old landfill and vehicle maintenance building / Stream Line bus barn. A 
very notable development that is currently underway is the new Bozeman Public Safety Center at 
901 North Rouse Avenue. This $36.4 million project broke ground in the summer of 2020 and 
will have an approximate gross building area of 95,000 square feet following its expected 
completion in the spring of 2022. 
 
In addition to the previously listed developments, Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport 
recently completed a second terminal expansion. The first expansion cost $50 million, making it 
the largest terminal expansion in the history of Montana. The three-story expansion increased the 
airport size from 75,000 square feet to nearly 200,000 square feet of space. The second 
expansion, completed in October 2020, cost $26.5 million and added another 75,000 square feet 
of space to the terminal along with four new gates, a new restaurant, and retail stores. This most 
recent expansion made the terminal the largest in the state. A four level, 1,100-stall covered 
parking garage was completed at the airport in 2019. The parking garage cost approximately 
$28.6 million and is the largest parking garage in the state of Montana. According to statistics 
from the Bozeman Yellowstone National Airport, a record-breaking 1,573,860 passengers passed 
 was up 17.3% from 2018 and representing the tenth 
consecutive year of record-breaking passenger traffic. Annual passenger traffic has nearly 
doubled over the past 10 years and accounts for 30% of all airline passengers traveling to and 
from Montana. However, the number of passengers in 2020 dropped approximately 43.5% to

889,775 as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. This drop was significantly less than the 
60.7% drop in nationwide airport passengers as reported by the TSA. 
 
In 2016, the Bozeman voters approved a $125,000,000 bond to construct a second high school in 
the western portion of Bozeman. The new school opened in Fall of 2020. A portion of the bond 
money will also be used to renovate the existing high school. At completion, it is projected that 
there will be 2,400 high school students enrolled in Bozeman high schools. 
 
Market Trends for Single Family Houses in the City Limits of Bozeman 
 
Bozeman has consistently accounted for about half of the population and housing growth in 
Gallatin County, and the following projections assume that this trend will continue. Bozeman is 
also expected to continue to account for a large share of the retail, office, major employer, and 
hospital markets going forward. With Bozeman capturing approximately half of the countywide 
housing demand, the following projection estimates demand for 12,700 new housing units in 
Bozeman over the 2017 through 2045 time period. On an annual basis, construction is projected 
at approximately 450 units per year on average compared to 600 units per year over the past 10 
years.  
 
 
 
The annual appreciation rates over the past five years have been in the 10% to 12% per year 
ranges in and around Bozeman, Belgrade, Livingston, and Three Forks. Home prices are highest 
just outside Bozeman City Limits for homes with large acreage. Home prices in Downtown 
Bozeman begin at approximately $700,000 to $900,000 for a home that has not been updated and 
needs major maintenance and upkeep. New construction, often redevelopment, in the Downtown 
area is typically priced over $1,000,000. Real estate values in Bozeman and the surrounding 
market area saw a very large increase in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and 
the resulting number of people relocating to the area from larger metropolitan areas. The charts 
from the Big Sky Country MLS on the following page demonstrate these value trends for single-
family and condo/townhouse properties in the surrounding market area:

Construction permits increased with the peak of the market in 2005 and 2006 and declined into 
2012. Building started to increase in 2013. Construction in 2016, 2017, and into 2021 has been 
strong and the trend is expected to continue. In fiscal year 2019-2020, 624 new housing units 
were built, along with 48 new commercial units. 
 
Tourism 
 
Yellowstone National Park is a significant generator of visitation to Bozeman.  Yellowstone 
visitation has gradually increased over the years, ranging from 2,835,651 visitors in 2005 to a 
record number of visitors in 2016 of approximately 4,257,177. In 2019, 4,020,288 visitors 
entered the park, the fourth busiest year on record. This decreased to 3,806,305 in 2020, largely 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the park was closed for approximately two months. 
However, visitation for September and October 2020 were the busiest on record. Yellowstone 
was the first U.S. national park, and with 3,472 square miles of land is larger than Rhode Island 
and Delaware combined.  It features an active volcano, more than 300 geysers, approximately 
290 waterfalls and the 136-square mile Yellowstone Lake.  Through the National Park Service, 
the park employs around 380 people year-round and 800 during peak summer season.  In 
addition, approximately 3,700 people work for concessionaires operating such services as 
lodging, foodservice, retail and transportation.  
 
 
 
The Big Sky Resort area is located approximately 45 miles south of Bozeman.  Originally 
conceived and built by the late NBC newscaster Chet Huntley, Big Sky first opened for skiing in

1974. In 1976, Michigan-based Boyne USA Resorts purchased the resort and they continue to 
own and manage it to this day.  Under the current management, Big Sky Resort continues to 
grow and provide year-round attractions for locals and tourists alike. The ski terrain has grown 
from an original four ski lifts that served 18 runs to now boasting 38 lifts that service more than 
300 ski runs. In 2018, Big Sky Resort implemented the first eight-seat, high-speed chairlift in 
North America. This is on the heels of the 2016 installation of a six-seat chairlift with heated 
seats and bubble covers in the Lone Peak bowl. Additionally, a new six-seat chairlift that 
replaced the existing Swift Current lift and wil
completed in 2020. These improvements are part of the Big Sky 2025 vision plan. 
 
During the winter season, Big Sky Resort offers winter activities such as snow shoeing, ice 
climbing, zip lining, sleigh rides and a high-ropes suspension course. Skiers and snowboarders 
are able to enjoy over 5,850 skiable acres spanning across three mountains. Big Sky Resort has 
seen annual skier visits surpass 500,000 in recent years. In the summer months, there are over 
13,600 private acres to enjoy activities such as horseback riding, mountain biking, hiking, rock 
climbing, tennis, fly fishing and whitewater rafting.  In addition, there is an 18-hole, par 72 golf 
course.  
 
Another development in Big Sky is the exclusive Yellowstone Club. As the only private ski and 
resort in the world, the Yellowstone Club is home to some of the most spectacular real estate and 
skiing in the country. This residential and vacation development has a $500,000 membership fee 
and a $50,000 annual fee. Included in the development are 2,200 skiable acres, with over 60 
runs. Pioneer Mountain has a peak elevation of 9,860 feet and an average annual snow fall of 
over 300 inches. The Yellowstone Club is also home to a private 18-hole mountain golf course.   
 
In 2012, Cross Harbor Capital, the owner of the Yellowstone Club, partnered with Boyne 
Resorts, owners of Big Sky Resort, to purchase Spanish Peaks, a 5,700-acre upscale golf 
community that was undergoing bankruptcy proceedings at the time of acquisition. In addition, 
Moonlight Basin, a ski and golf resort adjacent to Big Sky Resort, exited bankruptcy proceedings 
and was also purchased by Cross Harbor Capital Partners and Boyne Resorts in November of 
2013. After the purchase, the ski operations of both Big Sky Resort and Moonlight Basin were 
then combined to form the largest ski operation in North America, which now includes more 
than 5,850 skiable acres, 4,350 vertical feet and 38 chairlifts. A very notable development that 
underway in Spanish Peaks is the Montage Big Sky hotel and condominium project. This ultra-
luxury development is expected to cost $400 million and will include 150 guestrooms and suites, 
39 residential condominiums, a restaurant, lobby bar and lounge, market, pub, recreation room, 
bowling alley, indoor lap pool, family swimming pool, fitness center, spa, ski lockers, event 
space, and an approximate gross building area of 520,000 square feet. Construction is currently 
underway and the development is expected to be complete in 2021.  
 
Additional attractions in and around Gallatin County include Bridger Bowl which is 15 miles 
north of Bozeman, and Yellowstone National Park, located near the southwestern corner of the 
state.  Attractions in Bozeman include the Museum of the Rockies, the Emerson Cultural Center, 
and the historical Pioneer Museum.

The City of Bozeman is a City Commission/City Manager form of government with an elected 
Municipal Judge. These three entities form the legislative, executive and judicial branches of 
government. Five commissioners, elected with no party affiliation, make up the City 
Commission.  They are elected to four- year, overlapping terms and are part time officials. Terms 
are staggered, and elections are held every two years. The candidate who receives the most votes 
in an election becomes the Mayor the last two years of their term. 
 
There are three fire stations, one located on South 19th Avenue, one located on North Rouse 
Avenue and one on Davis Lane. Both the fire and police protections are considered good. The 
State of Montana assesses an ad valorem property tax to run public schools and other 
government agencies. There is also a State levied income tax in Montana but there is no sales tax 
in the state. 
 
Zoning Activity: 
 
Gallatin County administers the zoning code for properties outside the city limits, but within the 
zoning donut.  In general, planning and zoning regulations in the area are considered stringent. 
The Gallatin County Comprehensive Plan encourages development near existing cities and 
 enforces zoning 
regulation within the City Limits.  
 
Subdivision Activity: 
 
Subdivision activity began to increase in 2014 with the highest number of lots in the entitlement 
process in six years. In 2014, the Department of Community Development processed 58 
subdivision applications and 32 subdivision exemption applications, which represented a 143% 
increase over 2013.  Until 2013 there had been little planning activity by local developers due to 
market conditions, which caused a pent-up demand for residential building sites. As of 2021, 
there is more demand than supply for residential building sites. The Four Corners area west of 
the Bozeman city limits is expected to see significant growth in the near future with two large 
subdivisions receiving approval in late 2019. These two subdivisions are expected to create over 
200 combined residential lots. 
 
Environmental Factors: 
 
Environmental factors consist of both natural and man-made features that can influence property 
values.  These forces include but are not limited to climate, topography, natural barriers and 
transportation systems.  
zeman, 
Gallatin County and the entire State of Montana have four seasons. Summers are pleasant and 
characterized by warm to hot days, cool nights and an abundance of sunshine.  Humid conditions 
are infrequent. The average high temperatures in the summer ar
the 
average lows in the winter are in the mid- 
monthly 
temperatures for December, January, and February are 34 degrees and 15 degrees, 33 degrees 
and 14 degrees, and 39 degrees and 18 degrees, respectively.  Springs tend to come late in the

Gallatin Valley. The average annual mean snowfall in Bozeman is 72.1 inches and the average 
length of the growing season is 107 days. The climate of the county varies according to 
elevation, but it is generally characterized by relatively cold winters and warm summers. Typical 
operation costs that affect real estate are the inclusion of snow removal in the winter. Due to the 
fairly temperate summers, cool air conditioning costs are less; however, heating bills can be high 
due to the cold winter months.  
 
Conclusion 
 
In general, the outlook for Bozeman and the surrounding 
economy is diverse and anchored by Montana State University. With regards to the labor market, 
Bozeman has a young and very well-educated work force. The quality of life and outdoor 
activity will continue to be one of the driving factors for population growth in the Gallatin 
Valley. Gallatin County has a wide variety of excellent outdoor recreational opportunities.  There 
are cultural and additional recreational resources in Bozeman due to the presence of MSU, and 
the tourism industry in southwestern Montana is poised for continued growth.  Current 
population trends continue in an upward direction and growth has been sustained over the past 
decade.  There are no local employers or industries that are in imminent danger of changing 
unemployment levels. As well, there are no perspective employers moving into the area that are 
going to create a demand for employees. We expect to see continued steady population growth in 
the future for the greater Bozeman area. Residential and commercial activity has increased 
significantly. Residential apartment occupancy is nearly at 100%. Commercial lease rates and 
property values have been increasing as well.  
 
The long-term effects of the COVID-19 virus are unknown at this time and these circumstances 
will have some effects on the real estate markets on local and regional levels. Since the market 
was exposed to these conditions the week of March 16th, 2020, there is no way to quantitatively 
measure the long-term effects. It appears, however, that the COVID-19 global pandemic has 
positively impacted real estate values in Bozeman and the surrounding market areas as there has 
been an influx of buyers from larger metropolitan areas.

TAXES AND ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS 
The State of Montana, through the Department of Revenue, is responsible for valuing all taxable real and personal 
property. Department of Revenue field offices accomplish this property valuation. State guidelines are followed to 
ensure property is appraised in a fair and equitable manner. According to the Department of Revenue, all three 
approaches to value are considered in the appraisal process. 
 
The amount of property tax paid is not determined solely by 
o
lue is multiplied 
by a tax rate, set by the Montana Legislature, to determine its taxable value. The taxable value is then multiplied by 
the mill levy established by various taxing jurisdictions, city and county government, school districts and others, to 
provide services in the proper
s area. 
 
The following calculations are used to determine general property tax: 
Value x Tax Rate = Taxable Value 
Taxable Value x Mill Levy = General Property Tax 
The property tax process begins with an appraisal of the property. As of 2015, state law requires the Department of 
Revenue to reappraise residential and commercial property every two years. The most recent reappraisal was 
completed on January 1, 2020.  
 
Each year, the Department of Revenue field offices must certify the taxable value of all properties incorporated 
within the boundaries of each existing tax jurisdiction or school district. This valuation is then submitted to the 
taxing jurisdictions and the county commissioners.  
 
The taxing jurisdictions then set mill levies based on these values and the budget required to provide the necessary 
services. The levy is calculated by dividing the necessary budget by the taxable value. In addition to local levies, 
there are statewide mills mandated by the Montana Legislature to provide school equalization and funding for the 
university system.

Shown above are the 2020 county and 2021 city tax assessments for the subject property. The subject property is 
classified as exempt in the county assessments and is not subject to any county taxes. If the property sold and this 
classification were to change, it is likely the assessment amount would increase significantly. Included within the 
2021 city taxes was SILD # s 388 and 361 for the lighting districts of Mendenhall St from Church Ave to 3rd Ave 
and Main St from North Ida Ave to North 4th Ave. Based upon the total of the tax assessments, I have no reason to 
believe there would be any excessive tax burden on the subject property.

Flood Plain Information:   
The Subject is located in flood hazard zone. As shown by the flood map provided, the entire site 
is in the 500-year floodplain. Additionally, a portion of the western edge of the subject site is in 
the 100-year floodplain. There is no market support to indicate any adverse marketability from 
being in the floodplain. Per the City s guidelines, New building construction may be approved 
within the FEMA 100-year Floodplain outside of the Floodway if the building is elevated 2 feet 
above the 100-Year Flood Elevation.  Additionally, per the City s guidelines, New construction 
and building improvements may occur in the 500-Year Floodplain without a City Floodplain 
Permit.  Please refer to the Comment Addendum for detailed information.  
 
A small portion of the subject site is in the 100-year floodplain. It appears to be the area along 
Rouse containing the sidewalks. There is currently a site located at 240 East Mendenhall that is a 
development site which appears to have more floodplain and floodway than the subject and this 
site is currently under contract. There is no market data to suggest a negative impact to the 
subject property; however, this property has been exposed to the market longer than the typical 
exposure time in the CBD.

HIGHEST AND BEST USE 
 
Highest and Best Use is defined in the fifth edition of The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal 
(Appraisal Institute, Chicago, 2010), as follows: 
 
The reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or an improved 
property, that is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially 
feasible, and that results in the highest value.  The four criteria the 
Highest and Best Use must meet are legal permissibility, physical 
possibility, financial feasibility, and maximum productivity. 4 
 
1. Permissible Use. What uses are permitted by zoning and other legal restrictions? 
2. Possible Use. To what use is the site physically adaptable? 
3. Feasible Use. Which possible and permissible use will produce any net return to the 
owner of the site? 
4. Maximally Productive.  Among the feasible uses which use will produce the highest net 
return, (i.e., the highest present worth)? 
 
Highest and Best Use analysis is a three-step process.  The first step involves the Highest and 
Best Use of a site as though vacant.  The determination must be made to leave the site vacant or 
improve it. If the conclusion is to improve the site, the second step is to determine the ideal 
improvement.  The final step is a comparison between the ideal improvement and the existing 
improvement.  At this point, the determination must be made to maintain the property in its 
present form or to modify the improvements to more closely conform to the ideal use.

Conclusion 
Highest and Best Use As Vacant: 
The subject property is zoned B-3 Downtown Business District. This is a commercial use that is 
specific to downtown Bozeman. Primary uses are commercial retail on the main level, with 
offices and residential apartments on the upper levels. CBD zoning caters primarily to local 
retailers, restaurants, bars, banks, and hotels. This is not an industrial or primarily residential 
neighborhood. There have been several recent and successful developments with residential 
condominiums on the upper levels. All the necessary infrastructure is in place to develop the 
subject site. The location of the site is in an area that has seen significant redevelopment over the 
past five years. The sales used in the appraisal all had improvements that will likely be razed or 
redeveloped.   
 
 
Highest and Best Use As Improved: 
The existing improvements still have some physical life remaining. Structurally, the 
improvements are sound, just dated. The highest and best use as improved would be to try and 
lease the space at a rate that covers holding costs until a plan can be developed to redevelop the 
subject site. Typically, in Bozeman, this is a 12- to 24-month process.

THE APPRAISAL PROCESS 
Typically, real estate can be valued by applying three approaches.  All of these approaches to value, (particularly 
when the purpose of the appraisal is to establish market value) are market data approaches since the data inputs are 
presumably market derived. 
Cost Approach: 
 
One of the approaches to value commonly applied in Market Value 
estimates and many other valuation situations.  A comparative 
approach to the value of property or another asset that considers, as a 
substitute for the purchase of a given property, the possibility of 
constructing another property that is an equivalent to the original or 
one that could furnish equal utility with no undue cost resulting from 
delay.  The Valuer's estimate is based on the reproduction or 
replacement cost of the subject property or asset, less total (accrued) 
depreciation.  The cost approach establishes the value of a real 
property by estimating the cost of acquiring land and building a new 
property with equal utility or adapting an old property to the same use 
with no undue cost due to delay.  An estimate of entrepreneurial 
incentive or developer's profit/loss is commonly added to land and 
construction costs. For older properties, the cost approach develops 
an estimate of depreciation including items of physical deterioration 
and functional obsolescence.5 
 
 
Sales Comparison Approach: 
A comparative approach to value that considers the sales of similar or 
substitute properties and related market data and establishes a value 
estimate by processes involving comparison.  In general, a property 
being valued (a subject property) is compared with sales of similar 
properties that have been transacted in the open market.  Listings and 
offerings may also be considered.  A general way of estimating a 
value indication for personal property or an ownership interest in 
personal property, using one or more methods that compare the 
subject to similar properties or to ownership interests in similar 
properties.  This approach to the valuation of personal property is 
dependent upon the Valuer's market knowledge and experience as 
well as recorded data on comparable items. 6 
 
Income Approach:                            A comparative approach to value that considers income and expense 
data relating to the property being valued and estimates value through 
a capitalization process. Capitalization relates income (usually net 
income) and a defined value type by converting an income amount 
into a value estimate.  This process may consider direct relationships 
(whereby an overall capitalization rate or all risks yield is applied to a 
single year's income), yield or discount rates (reflecting measures or 
return on investment) applied to a series of incomes over a projected  
 
 
                                               period, or both.  The income approach reflects the principles of 
substitution and anticipation. 7

SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
 
The Sales Comparison Approach is one of the three traditional approaches to value.  It is also 
referred to as the Market Data or Market Comparison Approach.  It is defined as follows: 
 
The process of deriving a value indication for the subject property by comparing 
market information for similar properties with the property being appraised, 
identifying appropriate units of comparison, and making qualitative comparisons 
with or quantitative adjustments to the sale prices (or unit prices, as appropriate) 
of the comparable properties based on relevant, market-derived elements of 
comparison.8 
 
Basic real estate appraisal principles involved in this approach are the principles of substitution, 
anticipation and contribution.  The "principle of substitution" is the underlying premise from the 
Sales Comparison Approach and its definition is very similar to that of the approach itself.  This 
principle fundamentally states that the value of a property is influenced to a large extent by the 
prices being paid in the open market for similar properties offering the same utility.  It is 
irrational for somebody to pay an amount of money for a property that is greater than the price at 
which an equally desirable substitute may be acquired.  The market, which is made up of 
substitute properties, thus represents alternatives for a prospective buyer and tends to set the 
range of values. 
 
The "principle of anticipation" states that prices paid for property is a reflection of the market's 
expectation of future benefits that accrue from ownership.  It follows, then, that if the property is 
old and nearing the end of its economic life, or for another reason has a dismal future, the present 
worth of all future benefits would be considerably lower than if the property was new and could 
generate benefits for a longer period of time.  The value of real property, therefore, can be 
considered the present worth of all future benefits that can be derived from its ownership. 
 
The "principle of contribution" is the underlying rationale for the adjustment process in the 
Direct Sales Comparison Approach.  This principle views the sale price of real property as the 
sum of all value contributing characteristics.  The individual characteristics are measured by the 
effect their presence or absence has on the total sale price.  Not only is their mere presence 
important, but also the quantity and quality in which they exist. 
 
There are other appraisal principles involved in Direct Sales Comparison, but the three 
mentioned are considered most pertinent.

This is a commercial property one block north of Main Street in the Central Business District of Bozeman. The 
property is improved with an office building that has approximately 5,060 square feet of first floor office space 
and approximately 3,444 square feet of finished basement space that is utilized for storage; however, the buyer 
intends to eventually redevelop the site and therefore this is a land sale. The buyer owns the adjacent Etha 
Hotel property that was in the process of being developed as of the date of the sale of this sale. The property 
was not openly marketed and the transaction was privately negotiated between the buyer and the seller.

This is the sale of a property that was used by Gallatin Laundry Service for years. The property is located on 
the northwest corner of East Babcock Street and South Bozeman Avenue. The improvements were constructed 
in 1917 and has been used as a dry cleaning laundry service for years. The MLS listing did not provide any 
detail for the improvements and this is reportedly a land sale. The exterior may be used in redevelopment, but 
that is purely speculative. The building had the same 9,300 square foot size as the site. The property was 
originally listed for sale with an asking price of $2,200,000 in July of 2018 before going under contract for 
$1,800,000. The purchaser is a real estate developer.
All of Lots 11 and 12 of Block "B" of the original townsite of Bozeman, Gallatin 
County, Montana.

This is a large commercial property in the downtown Bozeman area that was formerly owner-occupied by Big 
Sky Western Bank. It includes a bank building with an approximate first floor area of 14,341 square feet and a 
13,971 square foot basement storage area as well as an undeveloped parking area. The property sold with a 
deed restriction that it cannot be utilized as a bank for the ten year period following the sale. While a majority of 
the value was thought to be in the land, the improvements have been remodeled for office and retail use. The 
property was not openly marketed on the MLS but was marketed by word of mouth. While the site is not 
located on Main Street, it is located one block south of it and is very well located in the core of the downtown 
Bozeman area.

This is the sale of an 8,400 square foot site that will be developed with an adjacent 8,400 square foot site with 
the Merin residential condominium development. The purchaser bought the southern one-half of Lots 35,36,37 
and 38 on March 16, 2017 for a price of $560,000. This is the sale of the northern one-half of Lots 35, 36, 27, and 
38. There were different sellers for each parcel. Originally this property went under contract for $1,285,000 on 
June 22, 2018 but the closing was then extended several times until the closing on November 14, 2019 for 
$1,450,000. The closing took place one day before the price was to increase an additional $25,000. The entire site 
is now in the process of being developed into a mixed-use building with 29 residential condominiums and two 
small commercial condominiums. The combined sites now contain 16,800 square feet of land area and therefore 
the total acquistion cost for the site is $2,010,000 or approximately $119.64 per square foot of land area. This is 
the approximately the fifth major development that the purchaser has undertaken in the Central Business 
District of Bozeman.

This sale was a private transaction. A local architect/development firm purchased the property for 
redevelopment. This is a prime development site located on the southwest corner of East Main Street and South 
Wallace Avenue. The improvements had previously housed a local grocery store named "Heebs" for years 
which has since relocated. It is also known that this site is part of the CMC Asbestos Bozeman Superfund Site 
which was historically used by the Chicago, Milwaukee Co. to store asbestos ore for milling prior to be 
transported elsewhere. The subject site is located on the eastern fringe of the central business district where 
there has been a considerable amount of redevelopment. According to the purchaser there will be costs 
incurred of $650,000 for asbestos abatement.

Site Valuation: 
The procedure used in estimating site value is direct market comparison, which involves 
compiling data on recent sales of similar sites that are competitive with the subject property.  
After the sales are gathered, they are compared to the subject as to time, conditions of sale, 
location and physical characteristics and adjusted for dissimilarities. The adjusted sale price of 
the comparables is used to form an indication of the site value for the subject.   
 
 
The preceding sales have been analyzed and compared with the subject property.  I have 
considered adjustments in the areas of:

Comparable Sale Adjustments 
All five of the comparable sales are redevelopment sites located in the CBD of Bozeman. All the 
sites had some form of improvements that were either razed or incorporated into a 
redevelopment project. The two major differences that were adjusted for were site size and date 
of sale. The overall market conditions are very strong and prices have been increasing fairly 
rapidly.  Smaller sites take much less time and risk to develop and the market data indicates they 
are selling at a much higher price per square foot. All of the comparables are zoned B-3.  
 
Sale 1 is fairly current and is located approximately four blocks to the west of the subject. Like 
the subject, this is a corner lot. The only major difference is the size and the fact that the location 
is closer to the center point of the CBD.  There was an office building on the site that will be 
rented until the purchaser finalizes some plans to redevelop the site. This rental does help cover 
carrying costs. A negative adjustment is warranted for site size.  
 
Sale 2 is also relatively current within the past 24 months. Again, this is a corner site with 
warehouse type improvements. The purchaser is currently trying to lease the improvements; 
however, there will need to be significant TI s completed to this building. For years, the property 
was used as Gallatin Laundry and is more or less warehouse space. Again, this sale is smaller 


================================================================================
PAGE 60
================================================================================

 
60 
 
and warrants a downward adjustment for site size. It also appears as if the purchaser will try and 
keep the existing building as they are completing some roofing work.  
 
Sale 3 is a major redevelopment site. This was the sale of the Big Sky Western Bank building. 
The property is being completely redeveloped into a 43,739sf building from a 28,312sf building. 
The building contained a 13,971sf basement that the developer has repurposed into office space. 
The site is much larger, twice the size of the subject. The comparison between this sale and the 
sale of smaller square footage lots supports the site size adjustment. 
 
Sale 4 is located less than 2 blocks to the northwest of the subject. The location of this property 
is further from Main Street than any of the other sales. The property has been redeveloped with 
The Merin residential condominium development. The developer paid a premium to plot the 
second lot to the site. Again, this is a much smaller site which warranted a size adjustment.  
 
Sale 5 is considered a truly relevant sale. The overall site size is similar to the subject. An 
adjustment was warranted for positive market conditions. The purchaser is responsible for 
approximately $650,000 in additional costs for asbestos abatement. The overall location is 
considered slightly superior because of the Main Street frontage, although the site is further from

The North 90 feet of Lots 32 and 33 in Block D of the Original Townsite of 
Bozeman, excepting therefrom a strip of land 8 feet in width on the East side of said 
This is a mixed-use commercial and residential property that is located one block north of Main Street in the 
core of the central business district of Bozeman. According to county records, the building includes 
approximately 1,008 square feet of basement commercial space, approximately 1,008 square feet of first floor 
commercial space, and approximately 756 square feet of second floor apartment space. At the time of the sale, 
the first floor and basement space was being utilized as a salon while the second floor was a two-
bedroom/one-bathroom apartment. According to the buyer, the commercial portion of the property will likely 
be converted into a marijuana dispensary. While the actual sale price was $826,625, the buyer is a real estate 
broker who waived the buyer's side commission of $23,375. Therefore, the effective sale price reflective of 
typical real estate commissions being paid is $850,000. The property was listed for sale with an asking price of 
$895,000 at the time it went under contract.

Improvements & Financial Data
This property was previously occupied as a savings and loan. The property was then purchased by 
Community Health Partners, who renovated and transformed the property into a community clinic. The 
renovation and remodel was completed in 2004. Overall, the building has been updated and is in average 
condition. The basement use is only for storage, there are no windows. This is a corner lot located in the CBD. 
In addition, there is a parking lot located just northeast of the subject that is part of the sale. This is a surface 
parking lot that has 29 striped spaces. The parking lot is located adjacent to Bozeman Creek and is located in a 
Floodway, which limits the buildablitiy of the site. The purchaser's intent is to add on vertically to the existing 
building and use the parking lot for allocated number of needed spaces. Accrording to the Broker, it will be at 
least 5 years before the redevelopment begins.

There really are no improved sales that are relatively similar to the subject for comparison. Sale 
1 is current and pending. The property is under contract for $296.16psf. Overall, the 
improvements are fairly basic. Like the subject, this is a corner site. In my opinion, the location 
is not as good as the subject.  
 
Sale 2 is odd and was included only because it is located about 1 block to the west of the subject.  
 
Sale 3 is current. This property is relevant because overall the square footage of the land is 
almost identical to the subject. However, there are two different parcels, and one is more or less 
designated as a parking lot due to a floodway designation. The subject site is considered superior 
to this property.  The building is in average condition and has been renovated and is useable. The 
building square footage is slightly smaller than the subject. The purchaser has future plans of 
increasing the square footage of the building by using the parking lot as allocated parking. 
However, it likely will not happen for at least 5 years.  
 
Overall, the indicated range of value based upon building square footage is larger than desired.

FINAL RECONCILIATION 
The process of reconciliation involves the analysis of each approach to value. The quality of data 
applied and the significance of each approach relating to market behavior and defensibility of 
each approach are considered and weighed. Finally, each is considered separately and 
comparatively with each other.  
Value Indications 
Land Value: 
$3,125,000  
Cost Approach: 
Not Applicable  
Sales Comparison Approach: 
$3,355,000 
Income Approach: 
Not Applicable  
 
Cost Approach 
The cost approach to value is not applicable to appraising the subject property and has not been 
formulated. Typically, the cost approach to value is more applicable to newer properties that 
suffer little or no depreciation. Had a cost approach to value been formulated, the final estimated 
value would be no more reliable.  
 
Sales Comparison Approach 
The sales comparison approach gives a good indication of value for the subject property. A 
comprehensive search for comparable sales was completed. I am not aware of any other sales 
similar to the subject that were not included in the report. The two main factors that affect the 
values of the comparable sales are positive market conditions and the size of the sites. The data 
obviously suggests that smaller lots sell for more per square foot. The subject is more similar to 
Sales 3 and 5, both of which are larger tracts of land, corner sites, zoned B-3, and had similar 
improvements on the site.  In addition, I have included three sales, one of which is pending, of 
improved sales that also support the final estimated value. One of the difficult circumstances in 
appraising the subject is that some of the sales were reported to be redevelopment sites and now 
the buyers seem to be wavering in the undertaking of development. Therefore, I have looked at 
valuing the subject property based upon both land sales and improved sales.

Water Rights:  
There are two wells located in the basement of the subject improvements with water rights of 
300gpm. The wells have been used by the City of Bozeman for years to force warm water into 
Bozeman Creek in the wintertime to mitigate ice jams. According to the City, they plan on 
relocating the wells with the existing water rights from the subject building. I do not believe this 
has any adverse effects on the reconciled value. None of the comparable properties sold with any 
type of water rights or wells.  
 
 
Value Conclusions  
 
The sales comparison approach is the only applicable approach to valuing the subject property. 
The quality and quantity of market data is good, and the indication of value is reasonable and 
reliable. 
 
Based on the data and analyses developed in this appraisal, I have reconciled to the following 
value conclusions, as of October 12, 2021, subject to the Limiting Conditions and Assumptions 
of this appraisal. 
 
Reconciled Value Conclusion: 
 
Estate: Fee Simple  
Value Conclusion: $3,240,000 
 
 
As a result of my investigation and analysis, it is my opinion that the Current Market 
Value  of the Fee Simple Interest, As 
the subject property, as of October 12, 2021, 
is: 
 
THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS  
 ($3,240,000)
