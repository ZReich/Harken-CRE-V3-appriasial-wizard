Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions
1. Our opinion of prospective market value as completed assumes that the proposed improvements are 
completed in accordance with plans and specifications as of August 1, 2024, the effective appraisal date.
2. We reached out to Billings City to see if the proposed Starbucks has been approved. We left messages, but 
received no response. It is assumed that the proposed Starbucks will be approved as planned.
3. An environmental assessment report was prepared by Terracon Consultants and originally performed in 
November 2022.  The results of this study indicated that there was “potential soil, groundwater, and/or vapor 
impacts from the historical on-site oil storage tanks” located on adjacent properties.  This study 
recommended further study, outside the scope of the original assignments.  More studies were conducted for 
both Starbucks and the owner, ascertaining the condition of not only the soil but the air quality within the 
improvements. The report provided to the appraisers concluded that no additional action is warranted. It is 
assumed the property is not adversely affected by environmental hazards and that remediation will be taken, 
if required.
4. Note, the property was inspected in conjunction with a previous appraisal report for the same client. No re-
inspection was completed for this appraisal report. It is assumed that the property is not materially different 
on the as is valuation date as it was on the inspection date. 
1. None
The use of any extraordinary assumption or hypothetical condition may have affected the assignment results.
The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions. A hypothetical condition is a 
condition, directly related to a specific assignment, which is contrary to what is known by the appraiser to exist 
on the effective date of the assignment results, but is used for the purpose of analysis.
The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions. An extraordinary assumption is an 
assignment-specific assumption as of the effective date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis 
which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser’s opinions or conclusions.
 
The value conclusion(s) in this report consider the impact of COVID-19 on the subject 
property.  
If you have any questions or comments, please contact the undersigned. Thank you for the 
opportunity to be of service. 
Respectfully submitted,

creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 1 
Appraisal Premise Definitions

Scope of Work 
Introduction 
The appraisal development and reporting processes require gathering and analyzing information 
about the assignment elements necessary to properly identify the appraisal problem. The scope of 
work decision includes the research and analyses necessary to develop credible assignment results, 
given the intended use of the appraisal. Sufficient information includes disclosure of research and 
analyses performed and might also include disclosure of research and analyses not performed. 
To determine the appropriate scope of work for the assignment, the intended use of the appraisal, the 
needs of the user, the complexity of the property, and other pertinent factors were considered. The 
concluded scope of work is described below. 
Research and Analysis 
The type and extent of the research and analysis conducted are detailed in individual sections of the 
report. The steps taken to verify comparable data are disclosed in the addenda of this report. 
Although effort has been made to confirm the arms-length nature of each sale with a party to the 
transaction, it is sometimes necessary to rely on secondary verification from sources deemed reliable. 
Subject Property Data Sources 
The legal and physical features of the subject property, including size of the site and improvements, 
flood plain data, seismic zone designation, property zoning, existing easements and encumbrances, 
access and exposure, and condition of the improvements (as applicable) were confirmed and 
analyzed. 
The financial data of the subject, including the purchase contract, lease documentation and 
construction costs were analyzed. This information, as well as trends established by confirmed market 
indicators, is used to forecast future performance of the subject property. 
Contacts 
In addition to public records and other sources cited in this appraisal, information pertaining to the 
subject was obtained from the following party: Mr. Ethan Kanning.

Scope of Work

Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Note, the property was inspected in conjunction with a previous appraisal report for the same client. 
No re-inspection was completed for this appraisal report. It is assumed that the property is not 
materially different on the as is valuation date as it was on the inspection date.  
Valuation Methodology 
Three approaches to value are typically considered when developing a market value opinion for real 
property. These are the cost approach, the sales comparison approach, and the income capitalization 
approach. Use of the approaches in this assignment is summarized as follows: 
Approaches to Value
Approach
Applicability to Subject
Use in Assignment
Cost Approach
Not Applicable
Not Utilized
Sales Comparison Approach
Applicable
Utilized
Income Capitalization Approach
Applicable
Utilized
   
The income capitalization approach is the most reliable valuation method for the subject due to the 
following: 
• 
The probable buyer of the subject would base a purchase price decision primarily on the 
income generating potential of the property and an anticipated rate of return. 
• 
Sufficient market data regarding income, expenses, and rates of return is available for 
analysis. 
The sales comparison approach is an applicable valuation method because: 
• 
There is an active market for similar properties, and sufficient sales data is available for 
analysis. 
• 
This approach directly considers the prices of alternative properties having similar utility. 
The cost approach is not applicable to the assignment considering the following: 
• 
The age of the property would limit the reliability of an accrued depreciation estimate. 
• 
This approach is not typically used by market participants, for similar properties. Specifically, 
the subject is a fast food building being purchased for re-tenanting as a Starbucks. The likely 
buyer of this property would base a purchase decision on the income potential from leasing 
the property, this buyer would not be interested in replacement cost as an indicator of value.  
Significant Appraisal Assistance 
It is acknowledged that Kammie L. LeFevre made a significant professional contribution to this 
appraisal, consisting of conducting research on the subject and transactions involving comparable 
properties, performing appraisal analyses, and assisting in report writing, under the supervision of the 
persons signing the report.

year-end 2012 and 2022, employment rose by 7,708 jobs, equivalent to a 9.8% increase over the 
entire period. There were gains in employment in seven out of the past ten years. Consistent with 
national trends, there were losses in 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a 
return to positive growth in 2021. Although Yellowstone County's employment rose over the last 
decade, it underperformed Montana, which experienced an increase in employment of 16.2% or 
70,375 jobs over this period. 
A comparison of unemployment rates is another way of gauging an area’s economic health.  Over the 
past decade, the Yellowstone County unemployment rate has been consistently lower than that of 
Montana, with an average unemployment rate of 3.7% in comparison to a 4.3% rate for Montana.  A 
lower unemployment rate is a positive indicator.

rate for Montana, a positive sign for the Yellowstone County economy but one that must be tempered 
by the fact that Yellowstone County has underperformed Montana in the rate of job growth over the

A Market Area Life Cycle typically evolves through four stages7: 
• 
Growth – a period during which the market area gains public favor and acceptance 
• 
Stability – a period of equilibrium without marked gains or losses 
• 
Decline – a period of diminishing demand 
• 
Revitalization – a period of renewal, redevelopment, modernization, and increasing demand 
The subject’s market area is in the growth stage of the Market Area Life Cycle.  
The Real Estate Cycle also impacts a neighborhood. The stages of the Real Estate Cycle include: 
• 
Expansion – Sustained growth in demand, increasing construction 
• 
Decline – Positive but falling demand, increasing vacancy 
• 
Recession – Falling demand, decreasing vacancy 
• 
Recovery – Increasing demand, decreasing vacancy 
The subject has been in the expansion state of the Real Estate Cycle. However, recent increases in 
interest rates, and general market uncertainty, have led to a slowing of market demand. At present 
the market appears to be in the decline state potentially moving toward recession.

Environmental Hazards 
An environmental assessment report was prepared by Terracon Consultants and originally performed 
in November 2022.  The results of this study indicated that there was “potential soil, groundwater, 
and/or vapor impacts from the historical on-site oil storage tanks” located on adjacent properties.  
This study recommended further study, outside the scope of the original assignments.  More studies 
were conducted for both Starbucks and the owner, ascertaining the condition of not only the soil but 
the air quality within the improvements. The report provided to the appraisers concluded that no 
additional action is warranted. It is assumed the property is not adversely affected by environmental 
hazards and that remediation will be taken, if required.   
Ground Stability 
A soils report was not provided for review. Based on the inspection of the subject and observation of 
development on nearby sites, there are no apparent ground stability problems. However, soils 
analyses are beyond the scope of expertise of the assignment participants. It is assumed the subject’s 
soil bearing capacity is sufficient to support the existing improvements.

A title report prepare by First Montana Title was provided to the appraisers in conjunction with this 
assignment.  From this, there appear to be no apparent easements, encroachments, or restrictions 
that would adversely affect value. This valuation assumes no adverse impacts from easements, 
encroachments, or restrictions, and further assumes that the subject has clear and marketable title. 
Conclusion of Site Analysis 
Overall, the physical characteristics and the availability of utilities result in a functional site, suitable 
for a variety of uses including those permitted by zoning. Uses permitted by zoning include variety of 
commercial uses. No other restrictions on development are apparent.

Real Estate Taxes 
44 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Real Estate Taxes 
Real estate tax assessments are administered by Yellowstone  County and are estimated by 
jurisdiction on a case by case basis. Real estate taxes in this state and this jurisdiction represent ad 
valorem taxes, meaning a tax applied in proportion to value. Taxes in Montana are calculated by 
applying a tax rate to taxable value. Taxable value is a percentage of the assessor's estimate of market 
value. The tax rate varies depending on a given county's budget. 
Real estate taxes and assessments for the current tax year are shown in the following table.  Note, 
future tax assessments may be somewhat higher upon renovation of the subject.  Therefore, current 
tax assessments are not representative of future tax assessments; however, they are provided for

Highest and Best Use 
45 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Highest and Best Use 
The highest and best use of a property is the reasonably probable use resulting in the highest value 
and represents the use of an asset that maximizes its productivity. 
Process 
Before a property can be valued, an opinion of highest and best use must be developed for the subject 
site, both as though vacant, and as improved or proposed. By definition, the highest and best use 
must be: 
• 
Physically possible. 
• 
Legally permissible under the zoning regulations and other restrictions that apply to the site. 
• 
Financially feasible. 
• 
Maximally productive, i.e., capable of producing the highest value from among the 
permissible, possible, and financially feasible uses. 
As Though Vacant 
First, the property is evaluated as though vacant, with no improvements. 
Physically Possible 
The physical characteristics of the site do not appear to impose any unusual restrictions on 
development. Overall, the physical characteristics of the site and the availability of utilities result in 
functional utility suitable for a variety of uses.  
Legally Permissible 
The site is zoned CMU1, Corridor Mixed-Use 1. Permitted uses include variety of commercial uses. 
There are no apparent legal restrictions, such as easements or deed restrictions, effectively limiting 
the use of the property. Given prevailing land use patterns in the area, only retail use is given further 
consideration in determining highest and best use of the site, as though vacant. 
Financially Feasible 
Based on the accompanying analysis of the market, there is currently adequate demand for retail use 
in the subject’s area. It appears a newly developed retail use on the site would have a value 
commensurate with its cost. Therefore, retail use is considered to be financially feasible. 
Maximally Productive 
There does not appear to be any reasonably probable use of the site that would generate a higher 
residual land value than retail use. Accordingly, retail use, developed to the normal market density 
level permitted by zoning, is the maximally productive use of the property. 
Conclusion 
Development of the site for retail use is the only use which meets the four tests of highest and best 
use. Therefore, it is concluded to be the highest and best use of the property as though vacant. 


================================================================================
PAGE 53
================================================================================

Highest and Best Use 
46 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
As Improved (As Proposed) 
The subject site is developed with a former Popeye’s Chicken restaurant which will be 
retrofitted/renovated to accommodate a Starbucks Coffee shop, which is consistent with the highest 
and best use of the site as if it were vacant. 
Parking will be adequate for the proposed use.  The building to land ratio for the entire parcel will be 
approximately 0.07, which is within typical market parameters for this property type.  No excess or 
surplus land will exist.   
The proposed renovation will be 100% leased upon completion of renovation and will produce a 
significant positive cash flow that we expect will continue. Therefore, the proposed use is concluded 
to be financially feasible. 
Based on our analysis, there does not appear to be any alternative use that could reasonably be 
expected to provide a higher present value than the renovated use, and the value of the 
improvements exceed the value of the site, as if vacant. For these reasons, continued retail use is 
concluded to be maximally productive and the highest and best use of the property as proposed. 
Most Probable Buyer 
Taking into account the size and characteristics of the property and its occupancy, the likely buyer is 
an investor.

Valuation Methodology 
47 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Valuation 
Valuation Methodology 
Appraisers usually consider three approaches to estimating the market value of real property. These 
are the cost approach, sales comparison approach and the income capitalization approach. 
The cost approach assumes that the informed purchaser would pay no more than the cost of 
producing a substitute property with the same utility. This approach is particularly applicable when 
the improvements being appraised are relatively new and represent the highest and best use of the 
land or when the property has unique or specialized improvements for which there is little or no sales 
data from comparable properties. 
The sales comparison approach assumes that an informed purchaser would pay no more for a 
property than the cost of acquiring another existing property with the same utility. This approach is 
especially appropriate when an active market provides sufficient reliable data. The sales comparison 
approach is less reliable in an inactive market or when estimating the value of properties for which no 
directly comparable sales data is available. The sales comparison approach is often relied upon for 
owner-user properties. 
The income capitalization approach reflects the market’s perception of a relationship between a 
property’s potential income and its market value. This approach converts the anticipated net income 
from ownership of a property into a value indication through capitalization. The primary methods are 
direct capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis, with one or both methods applied, as 
appropriate. This approach is widely used in appraising income-producing properties. 
Reconciliation of the various indications into a conclusion of value is based on an evaluation of the 
quantity and quality of available data in each approach and the applicability of each approach to the 
property type. 
The methodology employed in this assignment is summarized as follows:

Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Sales Comparison Approach 
48 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Sales Comparison Approach 
The sales comparison approach develops an indication of value by comparing the subject to sales of 
similar properties. The steps taken to apply the sales comparison approach are: 
• 
Identify relevant property sales; 
• 
Research, assemble, and verify pertinent data for the most relevant sales; 
• 
Analyze the sales for material differences in comparison to the subject; 
• 
Reconcile the analysis of the sales into a value indication for the subject. 
To apply the sales comparison approach, the research focused on transactions within the following 
parameters: 
• 
Property Type:  Starbuck’s facilities  
• 
Location:  Throughout the western United States 
• 
Size: Under 5,000 SF 
• 
Transaction Date:  Since late 2020  
For this analysis, price per square foot of gross leasable area is used as the appropriate unit of 
comparison because market participants typically compare sale prices and property values on this

Adjustment Factors 
The sales are compared to the subject and adjusted to account for material differences that affect 
value. Adjustments are considered for the following factors, in the sequence shown below. 
Adjustment Factors 
Effective Sale Price 
Accounts for atypical economics of a transaction, such as excess 
land, non-realty components, expenditures by the buyer at time of 
purchase, or other similar factors. Usually applied directly to sale 
price on a lump sum basis. 
Real Property Rights 
Leased fee, fee simple, leasehold, partial interest, etc. 
Financing Terms 
Seller financing, or assumption of existing financing, at non-market 
terms. 
Conditions of Sale 
Extraordinary motivation of buyer or seller, such as 1031 exchange 
transaction, assemblage, or forced sale. 
Market Conditions 
Changes in the economic environment over time that affect the 
appreciation and depreciation of real estate. 
Location 
Market or submarket area influences on sale price; surrounding 
land use influences; convenience to transportation facilities; ease of 
site access; visibility from main thoroughfares; traffic counts. 
Size 
Inverse relationship that often exists between building size/unit 
count and unit value. 
Building Quality 
Construction quality, amenities, market appeal, functional utility. 
Age/Condition 
Effective age; physical condition. 
Economic Characteristics 
Non-stabilized occupancy, above/below market rents, and other 
factors such as operating expenses, quality of management, tenant 
mix, rent concessions and other lease provisions. Excludes 
differences in rent levels that are already considered in previous 
adjustments, such as for location or quality. 
 
Analysis and Adjustment of Sales 
Adjustments are based on a rating of each comparable sale in relation to the subject. The adjustment 
process is typically applied through either quantitative or qualitative analysis, or a combination of 
both analyses. Quantitative adjustments are often developed as dollar or percentage amounts and are 
most credible when there is sufficient data to perform a paired sales analysis.  
While percentage adjustments are presented in the adjustment grid, they are based on qualitative 
judgment rather than empirical research, as there is not sufficient data to develop a sound 
quantitative estimate. Although the adjustments appear to be mathematically precise, they are

merely intended to illustrate an opinion of typical market activity and perception. With the exception 
of market conditions, the adjustments are based on a scale, with a minor adjustment in the range of 1-
5% and a substantial adjustment considered to be 20% or greater.  
The rating of each comparable sale in relation to the subject is the basis for the adjustments. If the 
comparable is superior to the subject, its sale price is adjusted downward to reflect the subject’s 
relative attributes; if the comparable is inferior, its price is adjusted upward.  
Adjustments are considered for the following factors, in the sequence shown below. 
Real Property Rights Conveyed 
For this analysis, no adjustments are required as each of the sales were transferred in leased fee.   
Financing Terms 
For this analysis, no adjustments are required. 
Conditions of Sale 
For this analysis, no adjustments are required as each of the sales are considered arms-length.   
Market Conditions 
The sales took place from August 2020 to May 2022. Market conditions were generally strengthening 
through early 2022. Increased interest rates have led to a flattening of prices since that time. At 
present there is some argument that prices are decreasing, but there is still insufficient data to 
determine the strength and duration of that decrease. No adjustment is applied after April 2022.

Location 
The subject is in a smaller market. The sales are generally considered superior in terms of location and 
downward adjustments are applied.  
Physical Characteristics 
This adjustment category generally reflects differences between the subject and the comparables, 
such as size, quality of construction, age and condition, and other physical characteristics that 
influence sale price.  
Size: The comparables range from 1,950 to 2,750 square feet. Recall, the subject has a size of 2,408 
square feet. Typically, as size increases, price per square feet decreases, and vice versa.  Utilizing this 
rule of thumb, appropriate adjustments are applied.

Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Building Quality: The subject will be an excellent Class “D” building in terms of quality of construction 
materials. All of the sales are similar in terms of building quality and no adjustment for building quality 
are necessary.   
Age/Condition: The subject will be effectively new upon completion and would compete with new 
properties in the market. All adjustments are applied at 1.0% adjustment for each year difference in 
estimated effective age, rounded to the nearest 5%.  
Economic Characteristics 
The subject's stabilized NOI per square foot is near $60.22.  The comparables range from $47.50 to 
$67.72 per square foot.  Because a number of the comparables had occupancy concerns, the NOI per 
square foot calculations are made here as they can be more credibly supported based on the actual 
income. 
A 3.0% adjustment for every $1.00 difference in NOI is made based on the subject’s stabilized NOI per 
square foot near $60.22.  Appropriate adjustments are applied.  Note, these adjustments are made as 
refinements.  Care is made not to double-count previously made adjustments.

Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Income Capitalization Approach 
57 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Income Capitalization Approach 
The income capitalization approach converts anticipated economic benefits of owning real property 
into a value estimate through capitalization. The steps taken to apply the income capitalization 
approach are: 
• 
Analyze the revenue potential of the property. 
• 
Consider appropriate allowances for vacancy, collection loss, and operating expenses. 
• 
Calculate net operating income by deducting vacancy, collection loss, and operating expenses 
from potential income. 
• 
Apply the most appropriate capitalization methods to convert anticipated net income to an 
indication of value. 
The two most common capitalization methods are direct capitalization and discounted cash flow 
analysis. In direct capitalization, a single year’s expected income is divided by an appropriate 
capitalization rate to arrive at a value indication. In discounted cash flow analysis, anticipated future 
net income streams and a future resale value are discounted to a present value at an appropriate yield 
rate. 
In this analysis, only direct capitalization is used because investors of single-tenant triple net facilities 
similar to the subject typically rely more on this method. 
Leased Status of Property 
The property is leased to a single tenant. Pertinent lease terms are shown below.

Considering the importance of the income stream, it is important to analyze the strength of the 
tenant.  Upon completion, the subject will be leased long-term to Starbucks.  Starbucks is a national 
chain who according to the 3rd quarter tenant profile study published by the Boulder Group, currently 
operates 33,800 locations throughout the United States and Canada.  Standard’s and Poor’s currently 
rates Starbucks with a BBB+ credit rating, which bodes well for the long-term viability of the chain.

Market Rent Analysis 
Contract rents typically establish income for leased space, while market rent is the basis for estimating 
income from future speculative re-leasing of space when the lease expires. Also, it is important to 
compare the current contract rent level with the market rent level. To estimate market rent for the 
subject, a search for comparable rentals within the following parameters was conducted: 
• 
Location:  Throughout the western United States  
• 
Space Size:  Under 5,000 SF 
• 
Date:  Since early 2020  
Comparable rentals considered most relevant are summarized in the following table.

Rental Analysis Factors 
The following elements of comparison are considered in our analysis of the comparable rentals. 
Rental Analysis Factors 
Expense Structure 
Division of expense responsibilities between landlord and tenants. 
Conditions of Lease 
Extraordinary motivations of either landlord or tenant to complete the 
transaction; non-arm’s length leases; large rental concessions; amortized 
tenant improvements in the lease rate. 
Market Conditions 
Changes in the economic environment over time that affect the 
appreciation and depreciation of real estate. 
Location 
Market or submarket area influences on rent; surrounding land use 
influences; convenience to transportation facilities; ease of site access; 
visibility from main thoroughfares; traffic counts. 
Size 
Difference in rental rates that is often attributable to variation in sizes of 
leased space. 
Building Quality 
Construction quality, amenities, market appeal, functional utility. 
Age/Condition 
Effective age; physical condition. 
Analysis and Adjustment of Rents 
Expense Structure 
The subject is leased on a  triple net lease basis. All of the rents are written on similar terms, and no 
adjustment for expense structure are necessary.   
Conditions of Lease 
The leases represent finished product of both the building shell and tenant improvements. No 
adjustments are necessary. 
Market Conditions 
The comparable rents were signed from January 2020 to November 2023. The rents are generally 
representative of current market rates as of the date signed. Most were done based at least partly on 
a construction cost return. This is common for similar single tenant properties. It is noted that lease 
rates for similar properties and costs increased through early 2022. Upward adjustment is applied 
through April 2022.

After analysis, the overall range is $46.11 - $72.26 per square foot per year. Note that the subject 
recently negotiated a lease for the subject, upon completion of construction, at $60.22 per square 
foot.  Although this is at the upper end of the adjusted data set it is not unreasonable.   
Market Rent Conclusion 
Based on the preceding analysis of comparable rentals, recent lease of the subject and trends evident 
in the market, a market rent conclusion of $60.22 per square foot is concluded. 
Gross Income Estimate 
Potential Gross Rent 
Potential gross rent is based on contract rent from the existing lease in place. Income is projected for 
the 12-month period following the effective date of the appraisal. In the following table, potential 
income from contract rent to potential income from market rent is compared.  Recall that the subject 
is anticipated to commence its lease in August 2023.

Expense Reimbursements 
Operating expenses are directly paid by the tenant; therefore, no reimbursement income is due the 
owner. 
Other Income 
Upon completion, the subject will be 100% leased for an initial term of 10 years, plus four additional 
five year-options.  This argues for the strength of the lease.   
Generally, in the market, no vacancy allowances are used for single tenant leased buildings similar to 
the subject.  Rather, the risk of the cash flow projection is typically handled in the capitalization rate.  
The capitalization rates extracted from the market, are analyzed on similar terms.  Therefore, no 
vacancy deduction is made in order to keep consistency. 
Effective Gross Income 
Effective gross income is calculated at $145,000, or $60.22 per square foot. 
Operating Expenses 
As stated previously, the subject is leased on a net basis in which the tenant is responsible for all 
significant operating expenses.  We have interviewed several market participants active in the sale, 
purchase or management of single tenant buildings encumbered by long-term absolute net or triple 
net leases to credit tenants to determine typical expense allowances.  We found that no management 
expenses are generally projected for these types of properties.  Therefore, to keep consistency, no 
operating expense are deducted, again to keep consistency within the market. 
Net Operating Income 
Based on the preceding income and expense projections, stabilized net operating income is estimated 
at $145,000, or $60.22 per square foot. 
Capitalization Rate Selection 
A capitalization rate is used to convert a single year’s estimated net income into an indication of value. 
Selection of an appropriate capitalization rate considers the future income pattern of the property and 
investment risk associated with ownership. The following methods are used to derive a capitalization 
rate for the subject: analysis of comparable sales, review of national investor surveys, and the band of 
investment method. 
Analysis of Comparable Sales 
Capitalization rates derived from comparable sales are shown in the following table.

A capitalization rate within a range of 3.48% - 4.85% is expected for the subject, based on the 
preceding information, averaging near 4.39%.   
National Investor Surveys 
Data pertaining to investment grade properties from the PwC, ACLI, and Viewpoint surveys are 
summarized in the exhibits that follow. 
 
We would expect the rate appropriate to the subject to be near or below the average rate in the 
survey data because Montana, considered a secondary market. 
The Boulder Group also publishes capitalization rate, relative to individual tenants.  Starbuck’s 
capitalization rates, as published in this study, are summarized in the following table. The following is

Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Reconciliation and Conclusion of Value 
72 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Prospective At Completion of Renovation - Reconciliation and Conclusion of 
Value 
Reconciliation involves the weighting of alternative value indications, based on the judged reliability 
and applicability of each approach to value, to arrive at a final value conclusion. Reconciliation is 
required because different value indications result from the use of multiple approaches and within the 
application of a single approach. The values indicated by our analyses are as follows: 
Summary of Value Indications
Cost Approach
Not Used
Sales Comparison Approach
$3,130,000
Income Capitalization Approach
$2,900,000
Reconciled
$2,900,000
Rounded
$2,900,000
 
Recall that the subject is currently under contract for purchase for $1,600,000.  However, this reflects 
the subject in its as is condition (fee simple) and does not reflect the renovation and/or lease to the 
Starbucks tenant.  Therefore, it has no bearing on this valuation.   
Cost Approach 
The cost approach is most reliable for newer properties that have no significant amount of accrued 
depreciation. The subject is a former Popeye’s Chicken restaurant which is being retrofitted to 
accommodate a Starbucks restaurant.   
Specifically, the subject is a fast food building being purchased for re-tenanting as a Starbucks. The 
likely buyer of this property would base a purchase decision on the income potential from leasing the 
property, this buyer would not be interested in replacement cost as an indicator of value. 
As a result, the cost approach is applicable to the subject and is applied in our analysis.  
Sales Comparison Approach 
The sales comparison approach is most reliable in an active market when an adequate quantity and 
quality of comparable sales data are available. In addition, it is typically the most relevant method for 
owner-user properties, because it directly considers the prices of alternative properties with similar 
utility for which potential buyers would be competing. 
The analysis and adjustment of the sales provides a reasonably narrow range of value indications. 
Nonetheless, it does not directly account for the income characteristics of the subject. Therefore, this 
approach is given secondary weight. 
Income Capitalization Approach 
The income capitalization approach is usually given greatest weight when evaluating investment 
properties. The value indication from the income capitalization approach is supported by market data 
regarding income, expenses and required rates of return. An investor is the most likely purchaser of 


================================================================================

Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
the appraised property, and a typical investor would place greatest reliance on the income 
capitalization approach. For these reasons, the income capitalization approach is given greatest 
weight in the conclusion of value.

Prospective Market Value At Completion 
This valuation assumes that the subject will be fully occupied upon completion of renovation, given 
that a lease has already been signed.  Therefore, the Proposed Market Value Upon Completion of 
Construction and the Market Value As Stabilized are the same with no deductions being necessary.

As Is Market Value 
75 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
As Is Market Value 
As has been discussed, in its as is condition the subject simply represents a vacant fast-food 
restaurant, formerly occupied by Popeye’s.  To come up with an appropriate value for the subject, in 
this condition, we imply the Sales Comparison Approach to Value which is the most applicable 
approach to this scenario.  To apply the sales comparison approach, we have researched similar 
vacant restaurant facilities throughout the western United States focusing on the following 
parameters:   
• 
Property Type:  Vacant Fast Food Restaurants  
• 
Location:  Throughout the western United States 
• 
Size:  Under 5,000 SF 
• 
Transaction Date:  Since late 2020  
For this analysis, price per square foot of gross leasable area is used as the appropriate unit of 
comparison because market participants typically compare sale prices and property values on this 
basis. The sales considered most relevant are summarized in the following table.

Sales 3, 4, 5 and 6 are similar and require no adjustment. Sales 1 and 2 are in the Denver market, 
which is superior to that of the subject market, and downward adjustment is made. 
Physical Characteristics 
This adjustment category generally reflects differences between the subject and the comparables, 
such as size, quality of construction, age and condition, and other physical characteristics that 
influence sale price.  
Size: The comparables range from 1,250 to 2,746 square feet. Recall, the subject has a size of 2,408 
square feet. Typically, as size increases, price per square foot of gross leasable area decreases, and 
vice versa. All of the sales The data set brackets the subject’s size very well and no adjustment for size 
are necessary.   
Building Quality: In its as is condition, the subject is a good quality Class “D” facility in terms of quality 
of construction materials.  This is similar to each of the comparable sales, and no adjustment or 
building quality are necessary.   
Age/Condition: In the subject’s as is condition, the effective age is estimated at 10 years.  All 
adjustments are applied at 1.0% adjustment for each year difference in estimated effective age, 
rounded to the nearest 5%.

Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions
1. Our opinion of prospective market value as completed assumes that the proposed improvements are 
completed in accordance with plans and specifications as of August 1, 2024, the effective appraisal date.
2. We reached out to Billings City to see if the proposed Starbucks has been approved. We left messages, but 
received no response. It is assumed that the proposed Starbucks will be approved as planned.
3. An environmental assessment report was prepared by Terracon Consultants and originally performed in 
November 2022.  The results of this study indicated that there was “potential soil, groundwater, and/or vapor 
impacts from the historical on-site oil storage tanks” located on adjacent properties.  This study 
recommended further study, outside the scope of the original assignments.  More studies were conducted for 
both Starbucks and the owner, ascertaining the condition of not only the soil but the air quality within the 
improvements. The report provided to the appraisers concluded that no additional action is warranted. It is 
assumed the property is not adversely affected by environmental hazards and that remediation will be taken, 
if required.
4. Note, the property was inspected in conjunction with a previous appraisal report for the same client. No re-
inspection was completed for this appraisal report. It is assumed that the property is not materially different 
on the as is valuation date as it was on the inspection date. 
1. None
The use of any extraordinary assumption or hypothetical condition may have affected the assignment results.
The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions. A hypothetical condition is a 
condition, directly related to a specific assignment, which is contrary to what is known by the appraiser to exist 
on the effective date of the assignment results, but is used for the purpose of analysis.
The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions. An extraordinary assumption is an 
assignment-specific assumption as of the effective date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis 
which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser’s opinions or conclusions.
 
The value conclusion(s) in this report consider the impact of COVID-19 on the subject property. 
Exposure Time 
Exposure time is the length of time the subject property would have been exposed for sale in the 
market had it sold on the effective valuation date at the concluded market value. Exposure time is 
always presumed to precede the effective date of the appraisal. Based on our review of recent sales 
transactions for similar properties and our analysis of supply and demand in the local single tenant 


================================================================================
PAGE 89
================================================================================

Final Opinion of Value 
82 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
coffee shop market, it is our opinion that the probable exposure time for the subject at the concluded 
market values stated previously is 12 months. 
Marketing Time 
Marketing time is an estimate of the amount of time it might take to sell a property at the concluded 
market value immediately following the effective date of value. As we foresee no significant changes 
in market conditions in the near term, it is our opinion that a reasonable marketing period for the 
subject is likely to be the same as the exposure time. Accordingly, we estimate the subject’s marketing 
period at 12 months.

85 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
This appraisal and any other work product related to this engagement are limited by the following 
standard assumptions, except as otherwise noted in the report: 
1. 
The title is marketable and free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, encroachments, 
easements and restrictions. The property is under responsible ownership and competent 
management and is available for its highest and best use. 
2. 
There are no existing judgments or pending or threatened litigation that could affect the value 
of the property. 
3. 
There are no hidden or undisclosed conditions of the land or of the improvements that would 
render the property more or less valuable. Furthermore, there is no asbestos in the property. 
4. 
The revenue stamps placed on any deed referenced herein to indicate the sale price are in 
correct relation to the actual dollar amount of the transaction. 
5. 
The property is in compliance with all applicable building, environmental, zoning, and other 
federal, state and local laws, regulations and codes. 
6. 
The information furnished by others is believed to be reliable, but no warranty is given for its 
accuracy. 
This appraisal and any other work product related to this engagement are subject to the following 
limiting conditions, except as otherwise noted in the report: 
1. 
An appraisal is inherently subjective and represents our opinion as to the value of the 
property appraised. 
2. 
The conclusions stated in our appraisal apply only as of the effective date of the appraisal, and 
no representation is made as to the effect of subsequent events. 
3. 
No changes in any federal, state or local laws, regulations or codes (including, without 
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code) are anticipated. 
4. 
No environmental impact studies were either requested or made in conjunction with this 
appraisal, and we reserve the right to revise or rescind any of the value opinions based upon 
any subsequent environmental impact studies. If any environmental impact statement is 
required by law, the appraisal assumes that such statement will be favorable and will be 
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies. 
5. 
Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, we are not required to give testimony, respond to any 
subpoena or attend any court, governmental or other hearing with reference to the property 
without compensation relative to such additional employment. 
6. 
We have made no survey of the property and assume no responsibility in connection with 
such matters. Any sketch or survey of the property included in this report is for illustrative 
purposes only and should not be considered to be scaled accurately for size. The appraisal

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
86 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
covers the property as described in this report, and the areas and dimensions set forth are 
assumed to be correct. 
7. 
No opinion is expressed as to the value of subsurface oil, gas or mineral rights, if any, and we 
have assumed that the property is not subject to surface entry for the exploration or removal 
of such materials, unless otherwise noted in our appraisal. 
8. 
We accept no responsibility for considerations requiring expertise in other fields. Such 
considerations include, but are not limited to, legal descriptions and other legal matters such 
as legal title, geologic considerations such as soils and seismic stability; and civil, mechanical, 
electrical, structural and other engineering and environmental matters. Such considerations 
may also include determinations of compliance with zoning and other federal, state, and local 
laws, regulations and codes. 
9. 
The distribution of the total valuation in the report between land and improvements applies 
only under the reported highest and best use of the property. The allocations of value for land 
and improvements must not be used in conjunction with any other appraisal and are invalid if 
so used. The appraisal report shall be considered only in its entirety. No part of the appraisal 
report shall be utilized separately or out of context. 
10. 
Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report (especially any conclusions as to value, 
the identity of the appraisers, or any reference to the Appraisal Institute) shall be 
disseminated through advertising media, public relations media, news media or any other 
means of communication (including without limitation prospectuses, private offering 
memoranda and other offering material provided to prospective investors) without the prior 
written consent of the persons signing the report. 
11. 
Information, estimates and opinions contained in the report and obtained from third-party 
sources are assumed to be reliable and have not been independently verified. 
12. 
Any income and expense estimates contained in the appraisal report are used only for the 
purpose of estimating value and do not constitute predictions of future operating results. 
13. 
If the property is subject to one or more leases, any estimate of residual value contained in 
the appraisal may be particularly affected by significant changes in the condition of the 
economy, of the real estate industry, or of the appraised property at the time these leases 
expire or otherwise terminate. 
14. 
Unless otherwise stated in the report, no consideration has been given to personal property 
located on the premises or to the cost of moving or relocating such personal property; only 
the real property has been considered. 
15. 
The current purchasing power of the dollar is the basis for the values stated in the appraisal; 
we have assumed that no extreme fluctuations in economic cycles will occur. 
16. 
The values found herein are subject to these and to any other assumptions or conditions set 
forth in the body of this report, but which may have been omitted from this list of 
Assumptions and Limiting Conditions. 
17. 
The analyses contained in the report necessarily incorporate numerous estimates and 
assumptions regarding property performance, general and local business and economic 


================================================================================

================================================================================

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
87 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
conditions, the absence of material changes in the competitive environment and other 
matters. Some estimates or assumptions, however, inevitably will not materialize, and 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur; therefore, actual results achieved during 
the period covered by our analysis will vary from our estimates, and the variations may be 
material. 
18. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective January 26, 1992. We have not 
made a specific survey or analysis of the property to determine whether the physical aspects 
of the improvements meet the ADA accessibility guidelines. We claim no expertise in ADA 
issues and render no opinion regarding compliance of the subject with ADA regulations. 
Inasmuch as compliance matches each owner’s financial ability with the cost to cure the non-
conforming physical characteristics of a property, a specific study of both the owner’s financial 
ability and the cost to cure any deficiencies would be needed for the Department of Justice to 
determine compliance. 
19. 
The appraisal report is prepared for the exclusive benefit of you, your subsidiaries and/or 
affiliates. It may not be used or relied upon by any other party. All parties who use or rely 
upon any information in the report without our written consent do so at their own risk. 
20. 
No studies have been provided to us indicating the presence or absence of hazardous 
materials on the subject property or in the improvements, and our valuation is predicated 
upon the assumption that the subject property is free and clear of any environment hazards 
including, without limitation, hazardous wastes, toxic substances and mold. No 
representations or warranties are made regarding the environmental condition of the subject 
property. IRR - Salt Lake City, Integra Realty Resources, Inc., and their respective officers, 
owners, managers, directors, agents, subcontractors or employees (the “Integra Parties”), 
shall not be responsible for any such environmental conditions that do exist or for any 
engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. 
Because we are not experts in the field of environmental conditions, the appraisal report 
cannot be considered as an environmental assessment of the subject property. 
21. 
The persons signing the report may have reviewed available flood maps and may have noted 
in the appraisal report whether the subject property is located in an identified Special Flood 
Hazard Area. However, we are not qualified to detect such areas and therefore do not 
guarantee such determinations. The presence of flood plain areas and/or wetlands may affect 
the value of the property, and the value conclusion is predicated on the assumption that 
wetlands are non-existent or minimal. 
22. 
We are not a building or environmental inspector. The Integra Parties do not guarantee that 
the subject property is free of defects or environmental problems. Mold may be present in the 
subject property and a professional inspection is recommended. 
23. 
The appraisal report and value conclusions for an appraisal assume the satisfactory 
completion of construction, repairs or alterations in a workmanlike manner. 
24. 
IRR - Salt Lake City is an independently owned and operated company. The parties hereto 
agree that Integra shall not be liable for any claim arising out of or relating to any appraisal 
report or any information or opinions contained therein as such appraisal report is the sole 
and exclusive responsibility of IRR - Salt Lake City. In addition, it is expressly agreed that in 


================================================================================
PAGE 95

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
88 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
any action which may be brought against the Integra Parties arising out of, relating to, or in 
any way pertaining to the engagement letter, the appraisal reports or any related work 
product, the Integra Parties shall not be responsible or liable for any incidental or 
consequential damages or losses, unless the appraisal was fraudulent or prepared with 
intentional misconduct. It is further expressly agreed that the collective liability of the 
Integra Parties in any such action shall not exceed the fees paid for the preparation of the 
assignment (unless the appraisal was fraudulent or prepared with intentional misconduct). 
It is expressly agreed that the fees charged herein are in reliance upon the foregoing 
limitations of liability. 
25. 
IRR - Salt Lake City is an independently owned and operated company, which has prepared the 
appraisal for the specific intended use stated elsewhere in the report. The use of the appraisal 
report by anyone other than the Client is prohibited except as otherwise provided. 
Accordingly, the appraisal report is addressed to and shall be solely for the Client’s use and 
benefit unless we provide our prior written consent. We expressly reserve the unrestricted 
right to withhold our consent to your disclosure of the appraisal report or any other work 
product related to the engagement (or any part thereof including, without limitation, 
conclusions of value and our identity), to any third parties. Stated again for clarification, unless 
our prior written consent is obtained, no third party may rely on the appraisal report (even if 
their reliance was foreseeable).  
26. 
The conclusions of this report are estimates based on known current trends and reasonably 
foreseeable future occurrences. These estimates are based partly on property information, 
data obtained in public records, interviews, existing trends, buyer-seller decision criteria in the 
current market, and research conducted by third parties, and such data are not always 
completely reliable. The Integra Parties are not responsible for these and other future 
occurrences that could not have reasonably been foreseen on the effective date of this 
assignment. Furthermore, it is inevitable that some assumptions will not materialize and that 
unanticipated events may occur that will likely affect actual performance. While we are of the 
opinion that our findings are reasonable based on current market conditions, we do not 
represent that these estimates will actually be achieved, as they are subject to considerable 
risk and uncertainty. Moreover, we assume competent and effective management and 
marketing for the duration of the projected holding period of this property. 
27. 
All prospective value opinions presented in this report are estimates and forecasts which are 
prospective in nature and are subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. In addition to the 
contingencies noted in the preceding paragraph, several events may occur that could 
substantially alter the outcome of our estimates such as, but not limited to changes in the 
economy, interest rates, and capitalization rates, behavior of consumers, investors and 
lenders, fire and other physical destruction, changes in title or conveyances of easements and 
deed restrictions, etc. It is assumed that conditions reasonably foreseeable at the present 
time are consistent or similar with the future. 
28. 
The appraisal is also subject to the following:

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
89 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions
1. Our opinion of prospective market value as completed assumes that the proposed improvements are 
completed in accordance with plans and specifications as of August 1, 2024, the effective appraisal date.
2. We reached out to Billings City to see if the proposed Starbucks has been approved. We left messages, but 
received no response. It is assumed that the proposed Starbucks will be approved as planned.
3. An environmental assessment report was prepared by Terracon Consultants and originally performed in 
November 2022.  The results of this study indicated that there was “potential soil, groundwater, and/or vapor 
impacts from the historical on-site oil storage tanks” located on adjacent properties.  This study 
recommended further study, outside the scope of the original assignments.  More studies were conducted for 
both Starbucks and the owner, ascertaining the condition of not only the soil but the air quality within the 
improvements. The report provided to the appraisers concluded that no additional action is warranted. It is 
assumed the property is not adversely affected by environmental hazards and that remediation will be taken, 
if required.
4. Note, the property was inspected in conjunction with a previous appraisal report for the same client. No re-
inspection was completed for this appraisal report. It is assumed that the property is not materially different 
on the as is valuation date as it was on the inspection date. 
1. None
The use of any extraordinary assumption or hypothetical condition may have affected the assignment results.
The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions. A hypothetical condition is a 
condition, directly related to a specific assignment, which is contrary to what is known by the appraiser to exist 
on the effective date of the assignment results, but is used for the purpose of analysis.
The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions. An extraordinary assumption is an 
assignment-specific assumption as of the effective date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis 
which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser’s opinions or conclusions.

Definitions 
The source of the following definitions is the Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate 
Appraisal, 6th ed. (Chicago: Appraisal Institute, 2015), unless otherwise noted. 
As Is Market Value 
The estimate of the market value of real property in its current physical condition, use, and zoning as 
of the appraisal date. 
Class of Retail Property 
For the purposes of comparison, retail properties are grouped into three classes: Class A, B and C. 
These classes represent a subjective quality rating of properties, which indicates the competitive 
ability of each property to attract similar types of tenants. The differences between these 
classifications vary by market, and Class B and C properties are generally classified relative to Class A 
properties. 
Class A properties represent the highest quality properties in a market. They have the best locations 
for retail use and the best access. Construction tends to be new and of good quality, and maintenance 
standards are high. Building and site designs are functional. As a result, Class A properties attract the 
highest quality tenants and also command the highest rents. 
Class B properties are a step down in quality from Class A properties. Class B buildings tend to be 
somewhat older, less functional, and less well maintained. Sometimes they are in less desirable 
locations. Class B properties command rents in the average range for the area. 
Class C properties fall into the lowest classification. These properties are older and often in need of 
renovation. Locations may be inferior and building and site designs exhibit functional obsolescence 
and lower standards of maintenance. Class C properties command rents that are below average for 
the area.

Common Area 
1. 
The total area within a property that is not designed for sale or rental but is available for 
common use by all owners, tenants, or their invitees, e.g., parking and its appurtenances, 
malls, sidewalks, landscaped areas, recreation areas, public toilets, truck and service facilities. 
2. 
In a shopping center, the walkways and areas onto which the stores face and which conduct 
the follow of customer traffic. 
Common Area Charges 
Income collected from owners or tenants for the operation and maintenance of common areas; 
typically specified in commercial and retail leases. 


================================================================================

Common Area Maintenance (CAM) 
1. 
The expense of operating and maintaining common areas; may or may not include 
management charges and usually does not include capital expenditures on tenant 
improvements or other improvements to the property. 
a. CAM can be a line-item expense for a group of items that can include maintenance of the 
parking lot and landscaped areas and sometimes the exterior walls of the buildings. 
b. CAM can refer to all operating expenses. 
c. CAM can refer to the reimbursement by the tenant to the landlord for all expenses 
reimbursable under the lease. Sometimes reimbursements have what is called an 
administrative load. An example would be a 15% addition to total operating expenses, 
which are then prorated among tenants. The administrative load, also called an 
administrative and marketing fee, can be a substitute for or an addition to a management 
fee. 
2. 
The amount of money charged to tenants for their shares of maintaining a center’s common 
area. The charge that a tenant pays for shared services and facilities such as electricity, 
security, and maintenance of the parking lots. The area maintained in common by all tenants, 
such as parking lots and common passages. The area is often defined in the lease and may or 
may not include all physical areas to be paid for by all tenants. Items charged to common area 
maintenance may include cleaning services, parking lot sweeping and maintenance, snow 
removal, security, and upkeep. 
(Source: Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 5th ed. [Chicago: Appraisal 
Institute, 2010]) 
Deferred Maintenance 
Items of wear and tear on a property that should be fixed now to protect the value or income-
producing ability of the property, such as a broken window, a dead tree, a leak in the roof, or a faulty 
roof that must be completely replaced. These items are almost always curable. 
Depreciation 
A loss in property value from any cause; the difference between the cost of an improvement on the 
effective date of the appraisal and the market value of the improvement on the same date. 
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis 
The procedure in which a discount rate is applied to a set of projected income streams and a 
reversion. The analyst specifies the quantity, variability, timing, and duration of the income streams 
and the quantity and timing of the reversion, and discounts each to its present value at a specified 
yield rate. 
Disposition Value 
The most probable price that a specified interest in property should bring under the following 
conditions: 
1. 
Consummation of a sale within a specified time, which is shorter than the typical exposure 
time for such a property in that market. 


================================================================================

2. 
The property is subjected to market conditions prevailing as of the date of valuation. 
3. 
Both the buyer and seller are acting prudently and knowledgeably. 
4. 
The seller is under compulsion to sell. 
5. 
The buyer is typically motivated. 
6. 
Both parties are acting in what they consider to be their best interests. 
7. 
An adequate marketing effort will be made during the exposure time. 
8. 
Payment will be made in cash in U.S. dollars (or the local currency) or in terms of financial 
arrangements comparable thereto. 
9. 
The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or 
creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 
This definition can also be modified to provide for valuation with specified financing terms. 
Effective Date 
1. 
The date on which the appraisal or review opinion applies. 
2. 
In a lease document, the date upon which the lease goes into effect. 
Entrepreneurial Incentive 
The amount an entrepreneur expects to receive for his or her contribution to a project. 
Entrepreneurial incentive may be distinguished from entrepreneurial profit (often called developer’s 
profit) in that it is the expectation of future profit as opposed to the profit actually earned on a 
development or improvement. The amount of entrepreneurial incentive required for a project 
represents the economic reward sufficient to motivate an entrepreneur to accept the risk of the 
project and to invest the time and money necessary in seeing the project through to completion. 
Entrepreneurial Profit 
1. 
A market-derived figure that represents the amount an entrepreneur receives for his or her 
contribution to a project and risk; the difference between the total cost of a property (cost of 
development) and its market value (property value after completion), which represents the 
entrepreneur’s compensation for the risk and expertise associated with development. An 
entrepreneur is motivated by the prospect of future value enhancement (i.e., the 
entrepreneurial incentive). An entrepreneur who successfully creates value through new 
development, expansion, renovation, or an innovative change of use is rewarded by 
entrepreneurial profit. Entrepreneurs may also fail and suffer losses. 
2. 
In economics, the actual return on successful management practices, often identified with 
coordination, the fourth factor of production following land, labor, and capital; also called 
entrepreneurial return or entrepreneurial reward. 
Excess Land; Surplus Land 
Excess Land: Land that is not needed to serve or support the existing improvement. The highest and 
best use of the excess land may or may not be the same as the highest and best use of the improved 
parcel. Excess land has the potential to be sold separately and is valued separately. 


================================================================================
PAGE 111
================================================================================

Addenda 
Former Popeye's Chicken/Proposed Starbucks 
Surplus Land: Land that is not currently needed to support the existing use but cannot be separated 
from the property and sold off for another use. Surplus land does not have an independent highest 
and best use and may or may not contribute value to the improved parcel. 
Exposure Time 
1. 
The time a property remains on the market. 
2. 
The estimated length of time that the property interest being appraised would have been 
offered on the market prior to the hypothetical consummation of a sale at market value on 
the effective date of the appraisal; a retrospective opinion based on an analysis of past events 
assuming a competitive and open market. 
Fee Simple Estate 
Absolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest or estate, subject only to the limitations 
imposed by the governmental powers of taxation, eminent domain, police power, and escheat. 
Floor Area Ratio (FAR) 
The relationship between the above-ground floor area of a building, as described by the zoning or 
building code, and the area of the plot on which it stands; in planning and zoning, often expressed as a 
decimal, e.g., a ratio of 2.0 indicates that the permissible floor area of a building is twice the total land 
area. 
Gross Building Area (GBA) 
Total floor area of a building, excluding unenclosed areas, measured from the exterior of the walls of 
the above-grade area. This includes mezzanines and basements if and when typically included in the 
market area of the type of property involved. 
Gross Leasable Area (GLA) 
Total floor area designed for the occupancy and exclusive use of tenants, including basements and 
mezzanines; measured from the center of joint partitioning to outside wall surfaces. 
Highest and Best Use 
1. 
The reasonably probable use of property that results in the highest value. The four criteria 
that the highest and best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical possibility, financial 
feasibility, and maximum productivity. 
2. 
The use of an asset that maximizes its potential and that is possible, legally permissible, and 
financially feasible. The highest and best use may be for continuation of an asset’s existing use 
or for some alternative use. This is determined by the use that a market participant would 
have in mind for the asset when formulating the price that it would be willing to bid. (ISV) 
3. 
[The] highest and most profitable use for which the property is adaptable and needed or likely 
to be needed in the reasonably near future. (Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land 
Acquisitions)

Investment Value 
1. 
The value of a property to a particular investor or class of investors based on the investor’s 
specific requirements. Investment value may be different from market value because it 
depends on a set of investment criteria that are not necessarily typical of the market. 
2. 
The value of an asset to the owner or a prospective owner for individual investment or 
operational objectives. 
Lease 
A contract in which rights to use and occupy land, space, or structures are transferred by the owner to 
another for a specified period of time in return for a specified rent. 
Leased Fee Interest 
The ownership interest held by the lessor, which includes the right to receive the contract rent 
specified in the lease plus the reversionary right when the lease expires. 
Leasehold Interest 
The right held by the lessee to use and occupy real estate for a stated term and under the conditions 
specified in the lease. 
Lease Type 
Full Service Lease or Gross Lease: A lease in which the landlord receives stipulated rent and is 
obligated to pay all of the property’s operating and fixed expenses. 
Full Service + Tenant Electric Lease or Gross + Tenant Electric Lease: A lease in which the tenant pays 
electric charges for its space but in other respects is a full service or gross lease as defined above. 
Tenant electric is often abbreviated as “TE”. (Source: Integra Realty Resources) 
Modified Gross Lease: A lease in which the landlord receives stipulated rent and is obligated to pay 
some, but not all, of the property’s operating and fixed expenses. Since assignment of expenses varies 
among modified gross leases, expense responsibility must always be specified. In some markets, a 
modified gross lease may be called a double net lease, net net lease, partial net lease, or semi-gross 
lease. 
Net Lease: A general term for a lease in which the tenant pays all or most of the operating and fixed 
expenses of a property. Whenever the term net lease is used, an analyst should identify the specific 
expense responsibilities of the tenant and owner. (Source: Integra Realty Resources) 
Triple Net Lease: A lease in which the tenant assumes all expenses (fixed and variable) of operating a 
property except that the landlord is responsible for structural maintenance, building reserves, and 
management. Also called NNN, net net net, or fully net lease. 
Absolute Net Lease: A lease in which the tenant pays all expenses including structural maintenance, 
building reserves, and management; often a long-term lease to a credit tenant.

Liquidation Value 
The most probable price that a specified interest in real property should bring under the following 
conditions: 
1. 
Consummation of a sale within a short time period. 
2. 
The property is subjected to market conditions prevailing as of the date of valuation. 
3. 
Both the buyer and seller are acting prudently and knowledgeably. 
4. 
The seller is under extreme compulsion to sell. 
5. 
The buyer is typically motivated. 
6. 
Both parties are acting in what they consider to be their best interests. 
7. 
A normal marketing effort is not possible due to the brief exposure time. 
8. 
Payment will be made in cash in U.S. dollars (or the local currency) or in terms of financial 
arrangements comparable thereto. 
9. 
The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or 
creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 
This definition can also be modified to provide for valuation with specified financing terms. 
Marketing Time 
An opinion of the amount of time it might take to sell a real or personal property interest at the 
concluded market value level during the period immediately after the effective date of an appraisal. 
Marketing time differs from exposure time, which is always presumed to precede the effective date of 
an appraisal. 
Market Rent 
The most probable rent that a property should bring in a competitive and open market reflecting all 
conditions and restrictions of the lease agreement, including the rental adjustment and revaluation, 
permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, term, concessions, renewal and purchase 
options, and tenant improvements. 
Market Value 
The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all 
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and 
assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of 
a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 
• 
buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
• 
both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their own 
best interests; 
• 
a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
• 
payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements 
comparable thereto; and

Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines, Federal Register, 75 FR 77449, December 10, 2010, page 77472) 
Overage Rent 
The percentage rent paid over and above the guaranteed minimum rent or base rent; calculated as a 
percentage of sales in excess of a specified breakpoint sales volume. 
Percentage Rent 
Rental income received in accordance with the terms of a percentage lease; typically derived from 
retail store and restaurant tenants and based on a certain percentage of their gross sales. 
Prospective Opinion of Value 
A value opinion effective as of a specified future date. The term does not define a type of value. 
Instead, it identifies a value opinion as being effective at some specific future date. An opinion of 
value as of a prospective date is frequently sought in connection with projects that are proposed, 
under construction, or under conversion to a new use, or those that have not yet achieved sellout or a 
stabilized level of long-term occupancy. 
Replacement Cost 
The estimated cost to construct, at current prices as of a specific date, a substitute for a building or 
other improvements, using modern materials and current standards, design and layout. 
Reproduction Cost 
The estimated cost to construct, at current prices as of the effective date of the appraisal, an exact 
duplicate or replica of the building being appraised, using the same materials, construction standards, 
design, layout, and quality of workmanship and embodying all the deficiencies, superadequacies, and 
obsolescence of the subject building. 
Shopping Center Classifications 
Convenience / Strip Center: Among the smallest of centers, convenience or strip centers include 
tenants that provide a narrow mix of goods and personal services to a very limited trade area. It may 
be anchorless or anchored by a small convenience store such as a mini-mart. This type of center may 
be configured in a straight line or have an L shape and has on-site parking usually located in the front 
of the stores. The size is usually 30,000 square feet or less in the United States or 40,000 square feet in 
Canada. The trade area usually comprises about one mile. 
Neighborhood Shopping Center: A local shopping center typically anchored by a supermarket, 
pharmacy, or both. A neighborhood shopping center offers consumable goods and personal services, 
and it usually serves a trade area within three miles of its location. Neighborhood centers typically 
contain 30,000 to 150,000 square feet of gross leasable area, including anchors. 
Community Shopping Center: Typically a shopping center that offers a wider range of apparel and 
other soft goods than neighborhood centers. Among the more common anchors are supermarkets,

super drug stores, and discount department stores. Community center tenants sometimes contain 
value-oriented big-box category dominant retailers selling such items as apparel, home improvement 
goods and furnishings, toys, electronics, or sporting goods. The center is usually configured in a 
straight line as a strip, or in an L or U shape. Of the nine most common center types, community 
centers encompass the widest range of formats. For example, certain centers that are anchored by a 
large discount department store often have a discount focus. Others with a high percentage of square 
footage allocated to off-price retailers can be called off-price centers. Community centers typically 
encompass 100,000 to 350,000 square feet of gross leasable area, including anchors. The trade area is 
typically three to six miles. 
Power Center: A large community shopping center with more than 250,000 square feet of space 
anchored by three or more tenants (category killer, home improvement, discount department store, 
warehouse club and/or off-price retailers) that occupy 60% to 90% of the space; the number of 
specialty stores is kept to a minimum. The trade area is typically five to ten miles. 
Regional Shopping Center: A shopping center that offers a variety of general merchandise, apparel, 
furniture, home furnishings, services, and recreational facilities, and is built around one or more full 
department stores. This type of shopping center is usually enclosed, with an inward orientation of the 
stores connected by a common walkway, and parking surrounds the outside perimeter. Regional 
centers typically contain 400,000 to 800,000 square feet of gross leasable area and include two or 
more anchors (full-line department store, junior department store, mass merchant, discount 
department store and / or fashion apparel) with a 50% to 70% anchor ratio and a primary trade area 
of five to fifteen miles. 
Super-Regional Shopping Center: A shopping center that offers an extensive variety of general 
merchandise, apparel, furniture, home furnishings, services, and recreational facilities built around at 
least three major department stores. They are similar in concept to regional centers but have more 
variety and assortment. Super-regional centers encompass 800,000+ square feet of gross leasable. It 
will typically include three or more anchors (full-line department store, junior department store, mass 
merchant, discount department store and / or fashion apparel) and a primary trade area of five to 
twenty-five miles.

Sale of a 1,600-square-foot quick service fast food restaurant 
at the northwest corner of W. Alameda Ave. and S. Yuma St. 
The tenant had expressed interest in purchasing the property 
so when the owner decided to sell, he offered it to the tenant 
first. The owner was also a commercial broker and was 
considering the cost of redevelopment when setting the sale 
price. No atypical conditions were noted. 
A free-standing fast food restaurant leased to Tacos Rapidos as 
of May 2019. Previously a Hamburger Stand.

By accepting this engagement, you (the addressee) or another qualified appraiser within your company selected by you, agree to review and sign the report.

Interior inspections of owner or tenant occupied areas will not be required until further notice
or guidance is provided. However, if the situation allows, please continue to inspect vacant
spaces and common areas or any area that you feel comfortable inspecting. The appraisal
should include clear commentary as to what has, or has not been inspected. If any notable
interior area remains uninspected, an interview with an appropriate informed party (owner,
manager, broker, tenant, etc.) is expected in order to determine the nature, quality and
condition of said area(s). This interview should be more in-depth than typically conducted
were the appraiser able to complete their own interior inspection; and cogent details in this
regard should be provided within the appraisal document. To address matters of uncertainty,
the use of an Extraordinary Assumption is allowed regarding the nature, quality, and condition
of any uninspected interior area(s). However, please provide clear commentary as to the


================================================================================
PAGE 193
================================================================================

 
basis of the assumption(s) made (i.e., reliance upon third party sources, interviews, and/or
photos; inclusive of those provided from owners, managers, tenants, the internet, etc.) and
properly disclaim that the employment of said assumption(s) may affect assignment results.
Purpose & Use:   The purpose of the appraisal is to provide your written results of an independent appraisal of the subject property. The appraisal report
will be used to assist First Interstate Bank in making loan underwriting and/or credit decisions specific to the Request Purpose below.
Scope of Work:  Unless specified otherwise in the following text, employ all applicable approaches supportive of the subject's highest and best use and
necessary to provide credible assignment results. Pertaining to scope of work, please consider the following:
     1. Property Information - It is your responsibility to obtain all property specific information, unless otherwise provided, directly from the designated
property representative listed below in order to credibly value the subject property (i.e., leases, operating statements, etc.). If problems persist in the
receipt of information that could jeopardize accuracy and/or timely completion of this assignment, please contact the Commercial Valuation Department
(CVD) immediately.
     2. Estate Valued - For valuations involving a scope of work relevant to a “fee simple” analysis, discovery of any rental agreements in place or
assumed to be in place upon completion (pre-leasing) and/or stabilization, beyond a month-to-month tenancy, requires modification of the requested
estate valued from “fee simple” to “leased fee”; which should be reflected throughout the appraisal report. Alternatively, if no independent 3rd
party lease encumbrances are in place on an assignment engaged as “leased fee”, a valuation of the “fee simple” estate should be undertaken.
Changes in this regard can be accomplished without a revised engagement contract.
     3. Extraordinary Assumptions and/or Hypothetical Conditions - If you find the need to employ an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical
Condition within the appraisal that is not identified or implied within this engagement, you must first contact the Commercial Valuation Department.
Contact must be made in writing, (e-mail preferred) describing the rational for additionally employed assumption/condition. First Interstate Bank will not
accept an appraisal that includes use of an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical Condition that the Bank has not previously approved.
     4. Owner Occupied Space - If the improvements encompass owner occupied or owner related leased space that could be vacated upon the date of
value, the appraiser must identify the most probable buyer of the subject property (investor and/or owner occupant) and reflect in the valuation process
likely market reaction regarding potential deductions (rent loss, tenant improvements, expenses, leasing commissions, etc.) for this space.
     5. Discounted Bulk Wholesale Analysis - If a Discounted Bulk Wholesale value is requested, the appraiser is to include analysis for the retail value
of each unit/lot within the report and provide an electronic copy of said DCF if completed in an Excel workbook. If there is any reason this proves to not
be applicable to a certain assignment, please contact a Commercial Valuation Department representative.
     6. Allocated Values - ALL reported values or interests (e.g., business value, going concern, fractional interest, FF&E, etc.) should be clearly labeled
and segregated in conformance with the value definitions section of the Master Commercial Appraisal Services Agreement (the business value
allocation must be derived based upon a depreciated Marshall & Swift & analysis, or some other empirical data). All values, inclusive of any component
parts, are to be delineated within BOTH your letter of transmittal and the body of the appraisal report.
      7. Marijuana - If in the inspection/appraisal process, there is discovery of any marijuana or illegal drug related activity relevant to the subject property
(i.e., tenancy, growing/manufacturing operations, etc.), it is required that the engaged appraiser immediately provide written notification to a Commercial
Valuation Department representative. If this situation occurs, all work on the assignment should be stopped as the file will be put on hold until further
instructions are received from CVD on how to proceed.
      8. Report/Addendum Supplements – Within your report, please provide the following items:
             a. Location maps for all selected comparables within each applied approach (in relationship to the subject), with photos included for all
                 lease and sale comparables (please provide street level photos for improved commercial/industrial properties).
             b. Letter of Engagement (signed by engaged appraiser AND selected appraiser completing the report, if applicable)
             c. Appraisal License and Qualifications/Resume
     9. Additional Scope of Work, if applicable:
       
If you determine that a change in scope is required, please notify a CVD representative in writing (email preferred) describing the rationale
for the needed change in scope. 
First Interstate Bank will not accept an appraisal that includes a change in scope that the Bank has not previously approved.               
Confidentiality/Fiduciary Duty:
      Personal and confidential information may be provided during this assignment. This information is not to be shared
without the approval by a representative of the Commercial Valuation Department at FIB, unless required by law. Please refer to Master Commercial
Appraisal Services Agreement regarding Confidentiality Clause of nonpublic bank customer and property information.
Release of Appraisal Information:
    The Appraiser shall not provide a draft copy, finished product, or distribution/disclosure of the contents or completion
date of the appraisal report(s) to any other party other than a representative of the Commercial Valuation Department. First Interstate Bank, at its sole
discretion, may release a copy of the Appraisal Report.
Fee:   Not to exceed $2,500.  No adjustment to the fee shall be made without prior written consent by a Commercial Valuation Department
