Appraisal of: Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
 
SWC Zimmerman Trail & Colton Boulevard 
 
Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana 59106 
 
CBRE, Inc. File No.CB22US072827-1 
 
At your request and authorization, CBRE, Inc. has prepared an appraisal of the market value of 
the referenced property.  Our analysis is presented in the following Appraisal Report. 
The subject includes a proposed 300-unit multi-family garden property and two separate 
adjacent land parcels on a combined 48.789-acre (gross) site located at the southwest corner of 
Zimmerman Trail and Colton Boulevard in Billings, Montana. The two adjacent land parcels, one 
12.126-acre parcel east of the proposed apartment development (Commercial Land Parcel) and 
the other 17.689-acre parcel west (Townhome Land Parcel), are not part of the subject apartment 
project and will be valued separately.  
The apartments will be built in two phases, with 180 units in Phase 1 and an additional 120 units 
in Phase 2 on a combined 16.444-acre site. The apartment project will consist of 14 three-story 
apartment buildings and a one-story clubhouse. The Phase 1 improvements are planned to be 
completed in August 2023, with the entire project complete in May 2024. The site has an 
additional 2.53 acres on its north boundary that will not be developed as apartments and is 
excess land.  
The subject is proposed construction. Therefore, we have also estimated the subject's market 
value at completion of construction and at stabilized operation.  
Based on the analysis contained in the following report, the market value of the subject is 
concluded as follows:

MARKET VOLATILITY 
We draw your attention to the fact that a combination of global inflationary pressures (leading to 
higher interest rates) and the recent geopolitical events in Ukraine, in addition to the on-going 
effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic in some markets, has heightened the potential for 
greater volatility in property markets over the short-to-medium term. Experience has shown that 


================================================================================
PAGE 10
================================================================================

Executive Summary 
vi 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
consumer and investor behavior can quickly change during periods of such heightened volatility 
and any lending or investment decisions should reflect this heightened level of volatility.  
Please note that the conclusions set out in this report are valid as at the valuation date only. 
Where appropriate, we recommend that the valuation is closely monitored, as we continue to 
track how market participants respond to current events. 
CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
The following is provided by CBRE Research as of July 2022. 
• In response to persistently high inflation, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate 
by 75 basis points (bps) on June 15, 2022, to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%. This was the 
biggest rate hike since 1994. 
• The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 9.1% annually in June (a 40-year high). Core 
inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 5.9%. Both exceeded 
economist expectations. 
• CBRE expects the Fed will raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points (bps) later in July 
and most likely by another 50 bps in September. 
• CBRE expects economic activity will slow but that a recession is unlikely this year. Amid 
slower growth and high inflation, CBRE forecasts the federal funds rate will peak at 3.75% 
in 2023. 
• Volatility in the credit markets is causing issues for investors, but activity in the commercial 
real estate markets has remained resilient as sellers expedite dispositions. However, we 
expect higher rates and slower growth will weigh on activity as the year goes on.  
The following table summarizes the CBRE Research House View as of mid-July 2022: 
2022
2023
2024-28
Federal Funds Rate (Q4)
3.25% to 3.5%
3.50% to 3.75%
1.75% to 2.00%
10-Year Treasury (Q4)
3.41%
2.56%
2.94%
 
Lower economic growth should still support continued strong commercial real estate 
fundamentals this year. Tightening in credit markets will continue to drive adjustment in the 
commercial real estate investment markets in the near term. Amid this uncertain and dynamic 
environment, investment market performance will be uneven with investors favoring high-quality 
assets in liquid or high-performing markets. We anticipate this to be the case across property 
types as investors look to lower risk.

EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTIONS 
An extraordinary assumption is defined as “an assignment-specific assumption as of the effective 
date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis which, if found to be false, could alter 
the appraiser’s opinions or conclusions.”  1 
• 
The ‘as complete’ value assumes the development is fully entitled and permitted for the 
construction of the improvements as specifically described herein, and that the project will be 
completed on time and within budget and in accordance with the plans and specifications 
described in this report. 
• 
The appraisal includes prospective opinions of market value at the completion and 
stabilization of the property. Those prospective values rely on forward looking projections that 
are based on current market indications and typical underwriting witnessed by market 
participants. Any significant change in market conditions that are inconsistent with the 
assumptions made herein could impact the opinions of market value. 
• 
The use of these extraordinary assumptions may have affected the assignment results. 
HYPOTHETICAL CONDITIONS 
A hypothetical condition is defined as “a condition, directly related to a specific assignment, 
which is contrary to what is known by the appraiser to exist on the effective date of the 
assignment results but is used for the purposes of analysis.”  2 
• 
None noted 
OWNERSHIP AND PROPERTY HISTORY 
Title to the subject is currently vested in ZHP Subdivision, LLC, L&L ZHP Subdivision, LLC, and 
Ludwig Consulting, LLC which acquired the property from KZ Bar Limited Partnership (Seller) on 
December 21, 2021, for $7,892,156 (including transaction costs), equivalent to $3.67 per 
square foot. Details of the marketing process were not available. That recent sale of the subject 
was an arm’s length transaction but does not provide an accurate indication of the subject’s 
market value, considering zoning and entitlements received and site work completed since that 
purchase. 
According to the Yellowstone County Recorder’s records, the Seller in the above transaction 
acquired the property on or before 2005. We are not aware of any additional ownership 
transfers of the property in the last three years. Since that recent purchase the current owner has 
obtained zoning and entitlements for a combination of medium (townhome) and high 
(apartment) density residential for the west 2/3 of the site and commercial office for the east 
portion fronting Zimmerman Trail.  They have also commenced site work, with grading and utility 
installation of the main interior streets and have begun construction on the 300-unit apartment 
property that is the subject of this report.

Executive Summary

Two portions of the subject are currently under contract. The east 16.67 acres (townhome land) is 
under contract to Infinity Homes for $3,550,000, equal to $4.89 per square foot. Additionally, 
1.26 acres of the subject commercial land located at the southeast corner of Colton Boulevard 
and Zimmerman Trail is under contract to Matt Robertson for $687,050, equal to $12.50 per 
square foot. That buyer owns the local NAI Commercial brokerage and reportedly plans to 
construct an office building on that property. Both of those transactions are scheduled to close in 
January 2023. Based on market data (local land sales) those pending sales appear 
representative of market transactions. The remainder of the property is not currently listed for 
sale. 
EXPOSURE/MARKETING TIME 
Current appraisal guidelines require an estimate of a reasonable time period in which the subject 
could be brought to market and sold.  This reasonable time frame can either be examined 
historically or prospectively.  In a historical analysis, this is referred to as exposure time.  Exposure 
time always precedes the date of value, with the underlying premise being the time a property 
would have been on the market prior to the date of value, such that it would sell at its appraised 
value as of the date of value.  On a prospective basis, the term marketing time is most often 
used.  The exposure/marketing time is a function of price, time, and use.  It is not an isolated 
estimate of time alone.  In consideration of these factors, we have analyzed the following: 
• 
exposure periods for comparable sales used in this appraisal, 
• 
exposure/marketing time information from the CBRE, Inc. National Investor Survey and the 
PwC Real Estate Investor Survey, and 
• 
the opinions of market participants. 
The following table presents the information derived from these sources.

Scope of Work 
This Appraisal Report is intended to comply with the reporting requirements set forth under 
Standards Rule 2 of USPAP. The scope of the assignment relates to the extent and manner in 
which research is conducted, data is gathered, and analysis is applied.   
INTENDED USE OF REPORT 
This appraisal is to be used to assist First Interstate Bank in making loan underwriting and/or 
credit lending decisions and no other use is permitted.  
CLIENT 
The client is First Interstate Bank. 
INTENDED USER OF REPORT 
This appraisal is to be used by First Interstate Bank. No other user(s) may rely on our report 
unless as specifically indicated in this report. 
Intended users are those who an appraiser intends will use the appraisal or review 
report. In other words, appraisers acknowledge at the outset of the assignment that 
they are developing their expert opinions for the use of the intended users they 
identify. Although the client provides information about the parties who may be 
intended users, ultimately it is the appraiser who decides who they are. This is an 
important point to be clear about: The client does not tell the appraiser who the 
intended users will be. Rather, the client tells the appraiser who the client needs the 
report to be speaking to, and given that information, the appraiser identifies the 
intended user or users. It is important to identify intended users because an 
appraiser’s primary responsibility regarding the use of the report’s opinions and 
conclusions is to those users. Intended users are those parties to whom an appraiser is 
responsible for communicating the findings in a clear and understandable manner. 
They are the audience. 3 
PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL 
The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the market value of the subject property. 
DEFINITION OF VALUE 
The current economic definition of market value agreed upon by agencies that regulate federal 
financial institutions in the U.S. (and used herein) is as follows: 
The most probable price a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all 
conditions’ requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, 
and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.  Implicit in this definition is the

consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under 
conditions whereby: 
1. buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
2. both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their own 
best interests; 
3. a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
4. payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements 
comparable thereto; and 
5. the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special 
or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 4

APPRAISAL METHODOLOGY 
In appraisal practice, an approach to value is included or omitted based on its applicability to the 
property type being valued and the quality and quantity of information available. 
Cost Approach 
The cost approach is based on the proposition that the informed purchaser would pay no more 
for the subject than the cost to produce a substitute property with equivalent utility.  This approach 
is particularly applicable when the property being appraised involves relatively new improvements 
that represent the highest and best use of the land, or when it is improved with relatively unique 
or specialized improvements for which there exist few sales or leases of comparable properties. 
Sales Comparison Approach 
The sales comparison approach utilizes sales of comparable properties, adjusted for differences, 
to indicate a value for the subject. Valuation is typically accomplished using physical units of 
comparison such as price per square foot, price per unit, price per floor, etc., or economic units 
of comparison such as gross rent multiplier.  Adjustments are applied to the physical units of 
comparison derived from the comparable sale.  The unit of comparison chosen for the subject is 
then used to yield a total value.   
Income Capitalization Approach 
The income capitalization approach reflects the subject’s income-producing capabilities.  This 
approach is based on the assumption that value is created by the expectation of benefits to be 
derived in the future.  Specifically estimated is the amount an investor would be willing to pay to 
receive an income stream plus reversion value from a property over a period of time.  The two 
common valuation techniques associated with the income capitalization approach are direct 
capitalization and the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. For a stabilized multifamily property

like the subject only the direct capitalization is applicable.  Investors and brokers analyzing these 
properties do not typically use a discounted cash flow.  Our analysis applies only a direct 
capitalization. 
Methodology Applicable to the Subject 
In valuing the subject, all three approaches are applicable and have been utilized.

OVERVIEW OF MONTANA 
Montana is among the most sparsely populated states in the union with a total land area of 
145,556 square miles and less than one million residents. The economy has traditionally relied 
upon natural resource industries such as farming, cattle, oil, gas, coal, and timber. However, 
over the last decade Montana has begun to diversify its economic base with greater emphasis on 
tourism (reflected in the natural resources of Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, as well as 
world-class skiing and fishing throughout the state) and a fast-growing high-tech manufacturing 
segment.  
Economic statistics for the state as of April 2022 are below and provided by the Montana 
Department of Labor and Industry:

OVERVIEW OF YELLOWSTONE COUNTY 
Yellowstone County is the most populous county in Montana and is nestled in the southcentral 
region denoted ‘Yellowstone Country’. The county seat is Billings. Yellowstone County is named 
for the Yellowstone River which roughly bisects the county, flowing southwest to northeast. The 
river in turn was named after the yellow Sandstone cliffs in what is now Yellowstone County.  
 
Yellowstone County is one of Montana’s fastest growing counties, with a 1.25% average annual 
growth rate from 2010 to 2020. That growth is projected to slow slightly over the next five years, 
attributed to a diminished economy resulting from low oil prices, which is tied to the local Bakken 
oil development. The growth projection is still well above the State of Montana overall. Billings, 
the county seat, remains the state’s largest city, with an estimated population of approximately 
167,587. 
Yellowstone 
County’s 
economy 
is 
relatively 
diverse, 
with 
construction, 
government, 
manufacturing, technology, retail, service, and agriculture all playing significant roles. Billings is 
the regional medical hub for the State of Montana, the largest private employers in the area are 
medical related. The county unemployment rate is at 2.4%.

OVERVIEW OF BILLINGS 
 
Billings is the largest city in Montana. Area attractions include Pompey's Pillar, Pictograph Cave, 
Chief Plenty Coups State Park, Zoo Montana, and Yellowstone Art Museum. Within 100 miles of 
Billings are Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation 
Area, Red Lodge Mountain Resort, and the Beartooth Highway, which links Red Lodge to 
Yellowstone National Park. Notably, from 2000 to 2010, Lockwood, an eastern suburb to 
Billings, saw growth of 57.8%, the largest growth rate of any community in Montana.  
The City of Billings and Yellowstone County each have comprehensive zoning plans and building 
codes which provide specific guidelines for development of all types of properties and is 
considered to have had a positive effect on the development of the city and county.

CONCLUSION 
Billings has seen steady growth and population and households over the last decade and that 
growth is expected to accelerate over the next several years. Agriculture has been one of the 
leading economic forces in Billings since its founding, and it continues to play a major role today. 
Because of extensive irrigation, the Yellowstone Valley and the northern Great Plains are some of 
the nation's most fertile agricultural regions. Billings is the transportation, processing, and 
packaging center for this large, productive area. The energy industry (oil, natural gas, and coal) 
is also an important part of the economic picture in Billings. The mountains around the city and 
throughout eastern Montana are a rich source of coal, oil, and natural gas. A number of 
refineries and purification plants are located in the Billings area to process the raw materials into 
usable energy resources. Billings is the retail and wholesale trade center for a vast area of land in 
the northern Rocky Mountain states.  
Billings is also the medical and educational capital of the region. The city's medical community, 
including two major hospitals and more than 40 clinics, provides the most advanced health care 
in the four-state area. Three major colleges and a highly rated public school system provide jobs 
and a well-trained workforce. It is also difficult to underestimate the impact of tourism and 
recreational diversity on the area's economy due to proximity of nearby Yellowstone National 
Park, as well as a wide array of other wilderness territories, mountain trails, rivers, and streams in 
the area bring much-needed tourist dollars and act as a magnet to companies and workers 
looking to relocate.  
In the long term, low business costs, educational attainment, stronger than average population 
expansion, and business-friendly environment are expected to continue to draw investment to 
Yellowstone County and the Billings area.

GROWTH PATTERNS 
Recent growth in Billings has been primarily on the west side of the city. The larger west-side 
development projects are below: 
Transtech Center 
The Transtech Center is a professional business park which provides state of the art infrastructure 
for competitive business activities. It was designed to meet the communication, power, and 
workforce needs of technology-based businesses and e-commerce. When complete, the center 
will include more than 500,000 square feet of high-tech office and industrial buildings, many of 
which will be owner occupied.  Development strategies include outright land sales to build-to–suit 
lease options. 
The center has a campus-like setting with 33 acres of common space. It includes eight water 
features and ponds, approximately 6,000 feet of walking trails, and more than 100 daily wildlife 
sightings. The facility utilizes a national fiber backbone for campus-wide communication with an 
on-site commercial data center.  
720-Unit Apartment 
Stock Land Properties, Inc. is building a 720-unit housing development on the 4100 block of 
Monad Road, west of the planned Rocky Vista University medical school, which is currently under 
construction. Construction on the housing development began in late 2021. The new market-rate 
units will be a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and are expected to rent for 
$900 to $1,900 a month. The complex will be configured and phased as four different 
communities, each with a pool, hot tub, workout facilities and a club house.  
ACCESS 
Primary access to the subject neighborhood is provided by Interstate 90, located about three and 
a half miles southeast of the subject with an interchange at Billings Boulevard.   
Interstate 90, which runs east and west across the northern portion of the U.S., runs diagonally 
through Montana, and along the south boundary of the City of Billings.  Interstate 90 is the 
primary transportation link within Montana, and connects Billings with the communities of 
Bozeman, Butte, and Missoula to the west, and eastern Montana.   
Several regional arterials are networked and intersect in and around Billings, providing regional 
access in each of the cardinal directions: US-87 to the north and south, SR-3 and SR-302 to the 
northwest, and I-90 to the east and west. Main Street (a.k.a. US 191) is the primary arterial road 
within. Montana Rail Link rail lines run through Billings, along the general path of Interstate 90.  
Historically, these rail lines have been an important part of the agricultural and timber industries 
of the region, but their importance to the economic base of Billings is waning.   
Billings has regional and national air service from the Billings Logan International Airport, located 
on the north boundary of the city. The airport is two miles northwest of downtown Billings, and is

the second largest airport in Montana, having been surpassed by Bozeman in both number of 
gates as well as annual enplanements in recent years. The airport is on top of the Rims, a 500-
foot (150 m) cliff overlooking the downtown core. Air carriers include United, Alaska, Allegiant, 
Frontier, and Delta airlines.   
Local access is provided by arterial streets such as Billings Boulevard, Montana Avenue, Grand 
Avenue and Central Avenue.  The commute to the downtown area of Billings is approximately five 
minutes.  Billings Logan International Airport is located approximately three miles north of the 
subject.

LAND AREA 
The maps and diagrams on pages 25 and 26 show site boundaries for the subject apartment 
land, townhome land and commercial land. The apartment land has a gross size of 18.974 
acres and includes the required open space, which is incorporated into that project’s site plan. 
Included in the parcel is excess land of 2.53 acres north of the apartment site along Colton 
Boulevard. That 2.53 acres is zoned for duplex use (10 buildings, 20 units) and is intended as a 
buffer between the subject apartments and the residential area north of Colton Boulevard.  
The townhome (NX1 and P1) land has a gross size of 17.689 acres but a net developable size of 
16.669 acres after subtracting 1.020 acres of required open space bordering Colton Boulevard.  
Land area for the commercial zoned portion of the site was reported at 12.126 acres.  
INGRESS/EGRESS 
Ingress and egress will be available to the site via four curb cuts along Avenue E, a road that will 
be constructed with the subject; as well as from four curb cuts along Green Valley Drive, which is 
another road that will be constructed with the subject. 
EASEMENTS AND ENCROACHMENTS 
There are no known easements or encroachments impacting the site that negatively affect the 
marketability or highest and best use.  It is recommended that the client/reader obtain a current 
title policy outlining all easements and encroachments on the property, if any, prior to making a 
business decision. 
COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
There are no known covenants, conditions or restrictions impacting the site that negatively affect 
the marketability or highest and best use.  It is recommended that the client/reader obtain a copy 
of the current covenants, conditions and restrictions, if any, prior to making a business decision. 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
Although CBRE was not provided an Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), a tour of the site did 
not reveal any obvious issues regarding environmental contamination or adverse conditions. 
The appraiser is not qualified to detect the existence of potentially hazardous material or 
underground storage tanks which may be present on or near the site.  The existence of 
hazardous materials or underground storage tanks may affect the value of the property.  For this

According to the City of Billings Planning and Zoning Department: 
NX1 (Mixed Residential 1) 
The NX1 district is intended to continue the character of the first neighborhoods with single-family, 
two-family, and small-scale multiple-family homes with three (3) to four (4) units. Multiple-family 
homes are intended to match the scale of the neighborhood single-family homes with characteristics 
such as building width, parking and garages location, roof design, and doors and windows on the 
front facades. 
NX3 (Mixed Residential 3) 
The NX3 district is intended for large-scale multiple-family homes in larger neighborhood nodes. The 
buildings may include larger apartment buildings with more than eight (8) units per structure. The 
development may have an internal private street system for access throughout the larger node with 
walkable blocks. Buildings are oriented to the street with doors and windows on front facades and

parking/garages located behind the buildings. Covered parking may include rows of canopies or 
enclosed garages. Common open space, shared recreational facilities, or central gathering spaces 
are generally provided for residents. 
P1 (Open Space, Parks, Recreation) 
The P1 district is intended to protect and preserve open spaces that are held in either public or 
private ownership. P1 districts may include parks, open spaces, trails, wetlands, floodplains, 
environmentally sensitive areas, and unique habitats and landscapes. To preserve access to clean 
air, pure water, natural recreation areas, and scenic natural beauty, the subdivision and 
development of land is restricted in P1 districts. 
NO (Neighborhood Office-Residential) 
The NO district is intended to accommodate office and office/residential uses on neighborhood 
corridors and internal neighborhood locations where other commercial uses are inappropriate. This 
district is meant to be highly walkable and accessible to pedestrians and to fit well with the context of 
adjacent neighborhood residential buildings, when located on corners or block ends. 
N2 (Mid Century Neighborhood Residential) 
The N2 district is intended to continue the existing character of the residential neighborhoods with 
single- and two-family homes developed during the middle of the twentieth century. This district may 
also be used for new neighborhoods designed with similar characteristics of the mid-century 
neighborhoods. These characteristics include homes wide on the lot, proportionate garages located 
in the front façade, low pitched roofs, and doors and windows on the front facades. Building and 
garage location are specified in the regulations, with basic parameters for front doors and windows. 
N3 (Suburban Neighborhood Residential) 
Suburban neighborhood residential. The N3 district is intended for residential neighborhoods 
primarily with single-family homes. Characteristics include wide lots and attached garages typically 
located on the front building façade, often greater than thirty-five (35) percent of the façade. Basic 
setback and height parameters apply. 
ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION 
It is assumed the improvements will represent a legal, conforming use, which if damaged, may 
be restored without special permit application. 
Although our review did not reveal any zoning issues, we are not qualified to render a legal 
opinion regarding zoning compliance.  The client is urged to retain an expert in the field for that 
purpose.

The State of Montana determines the market value of commercial properties every two years on 
January 1st and applies a percentage to the assessed market value to determine a taxable value.  
Properties that are under construction are reassessed annually.  A mill levy rate is then applied to 
the taxable value resulting in taxes due. Taxes are payable in arrears in two payments in 
December and the following May.  The most recent assessment of the subject was in January 
2021. 
The assessed values are shown above for 2021 and 2022. The effective tax rate is shown for 
2021 for the subject as land only. The 2022 tax rates will not be available until later in the year.  
Montana is a non-reporting, or non-disclosure state.  However, when a property sells, a realty 
transfer certificate is required to be filed with the state Department of Revenue.  That information 
remains confidential but may be used by the department in a subsequent reassessment. 
According to the Yellowstone County Treasurer, there are no outstanding taxes payable. For 
purposes of this analysis, CBRE, Inc. assumes that all taxes are current. 
TAX COMPARABLES 
To estimate the applicable real estate taxes for the proposed subject apartment project as 
stabilized, CBRE, Inc. has reviewed the 2021-2022 assessed market values for comparable 
properties in the market area as reported by the Yellowstone County Assessor. The following 
table summarizes the comparables employed for this analysis:

The assessed market value of the tax comparables have a wide range from approximately 
$99,000 to $186,000 per unit, or $92 to $170 per square foot of rentable area. We have 
estimated an assessed market value equal to $170 per square foot for the property, at the high 
end of the comparable range, considering the subject’s new construction and finish quality. It is 
typical for properties to be assessed at amounts below actual market value to reduce tax 
appeals. It is typical for properties to be assessed at amounts below actual market value to 
reduce tax appeals.   
CONCLUSION 
Taxes for the subject have been estimated at $370,623 for the subject’s Phase 1 units and 
$617,705 for the total project by applying the neighborhood 2021 tax rate by to our estimated 
assessed market values.

Avenue C is a 126-unit upscale midrise and the newest and most comparable development with 
available absorption statistics; however, its lease up process was not well managed and its results 
are not reflective of market conditions, so we have not included the results in our analysis. 
InterUrban is one of the first highly-amenitized properties to develop in the west end of Billings at 
610 South 44th Street West. It’s absorption in 2017 was 7.7 units per month. Shiloh Commons is 
a 144-unit mixed-use property with over 61,000 square feet of street-level retail at 115 Shiloh 
Road. It’s 2019 lease up activity is similar to InterUrban at 7.5 units absorbed per month. Those 
properties each pushed the upper end of the local rental market at the time of their completion 
and are good examples for a minimum level of performance that should be expected for the 
subject.   
Demand for rental housing has increased significantly since 2019. Billings has experienced 
significant increases in home values and rent levels. The median listing home price in Billings was 
$398,000 in June 2022, trending up 24.1% year-over-year and asking rents increased 9% year-
over-year. As in many cities in the region, many Billings households enjoy lower rents than what

Housing Coalition reports that Montana has a shortage of 18,538 rental units. Specific statistics 
for Billings were not available.  However, occupancy in Billings is currently 97.6%, well above the 
92%-95% range typically considered stabilized. Additionally, as previously discussed, population 
and employment in the area re expected to continue to grow.    
Cost to Achieve Stabilized Operations

operating at a stabilized level. Stabilized occupancy for the subject has been estimated at 95.0%, 
equal to 285 units.  
The subject will be built in two phases, with 180 units in Phase 1 and another 120 units in Phase 
2 for a total of 300 units for the project. The developer’s construction timeline is shown below:

*Assume tenants can move in the month following delivery; Clubhouse delivered in March 2023
Compiled by CBRE
 
Phase 1 leasing is planned to start in February of 2023 with completion of 180 units and the 
clubhouse in August of 2023. Phase 2 is planned to begin in January of 2024 when Phase 1 is 
approximately 50% leased. Completion of all 300 units is planned for May of 2024. The first 
move-ins will begin in April 2023 after completion of the clubhouse in March.

Market Analysis

Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
The average absorption for lease up properties listed above is 8 units per month; however, the 
leasing history is from 2017 and 2019. Demand for rental housing has increased since that time. 
Although we have no recent comparables, low vacancy rates and consistently rising market rents 
indicate high demand. Our comparable rental analysis (See Income Capitalization section below) 
examined newer, higher end Billings apartment properties and all had occupancy rates of 97% or 
above. Therefore, we estimate absorption of approximately 10 units per month, slightly above the 
comparable data. The lease-up assumptions are summarized below.

The developer anticipates Phase 1 completion in August 2023. The subject property will have 180 
units and will need to lease a total of 171 units to reach stabilized occupancy. Our proforma 
assumes the subject will lease 60 units prior to completion (which assumes preleasing at 10 units 
per month). The first completed unit is expected to be delivered in February of 2023. The 
remaining 111 units will be leased over a period of 12 months at 10 units per month. 
Considering absorption at other properties lease up concessions are not anticipated.  A profit of 
20.00% is estimated based on comparable investment instruments. The resulting lease up 
discount is deducted as a line item from each approach to render an “as complete” value 
estimate.

The developer anticipates Phase 2 completion in May of 2024. For the entire project, the subject 
property will have 300 units and will need to lease a total of 285 units to reach stabilized 
occupancy. Our pro forma assumes the subject will lease 150 units prior to completion (which 
assumes preleasing at 10 units per month).  The remaining 135 units are projected to be leased 
over the 13.5 months following construction end at 10 per month. Considering absorption at 
other properties lease up concessions are not anticipated.  A profit of 20.00% is estimated based 
on comparable investment instruments. The resulting lease up discount is deducted as a line item 
from each approach to render an “as complete” value estimate. This analysis utilizes assumptions 
developed in the Market Analysis and Income Capitalization Approach.   The Lease-Up Discount 
Schedule is included below:

Lease-Up Discount 
The lease up discount represents the income lost to vacancy below the stabilized level. The Lease 
Up Discount Schedule (LUD) shows the subject’s budgeted net operating income As Stabilized 
and also an estimate of the subject’s As Is net operating income based on the lease up 
assumptions discussed above. The line items in the As Is budget that vary from the As Stabilized 
are indicated below: 
• 
Vacancy and Credit Loss – stabilized vacancy has been concluded at 5%. As Is vacancy starts 
the first month after completion. For example, in the table above, the month one vacancy is 
47%. This is consistent with month 24 in the Construction and Leasing Schedule presented in 
the section above.  
• 
Other Income – other income is non-rental income typically generated by tenants for items 
such as pet rent, late fees, etc. As Stabilized Other Income is a fixed monthly amount. The As 
Is Other Income is adjusted to account for planned vacancy as follows: (As Stabilized Other 
Income / Concluded Occupancy Rate) * As Is Occupancy Rate. For example, in the LUD 
above, As Stabilized Occupancy is $40,501 per month. The As Is Other Income for month 
one is $40,501 / .95 * .533 = $22,738. The greater the month-to-month variation in 
occupancy, the greater the change in As Is Other Income.  
• 
Profit is added to the As Is value based on comparable investment instruments.

Market Analysis 
56 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
 CONCLUSION 
The Billings market has seen consistent growth over the last decade and is forecast for increasing 
growth over the next several years. The multifamily market continues to be extremely strong, with 
the subject’s occupancy at 99.0% and the Billings Metro market occupancy at 97.6%.  
With elevated inflation expected to persist, the Fed likely will continue to focus on easing price 
pressures, with the potential for increases of at least 50 bps at its next two meetings in July and 
September. Volatility in the credit markets is causing issues for investors, but activity in the 
commercial real estate markets has remained resilient as sellers expedite dispositions. However, 
we expect higher interest rates and slower growth will weigh on activity as the year goes on.  
The subject is well located.  The property is in reasonable proximity to employment and shopping 
centers and major roadways, and similar area apartment developments (rent comparables) are 
experiencing stabilized levels of demand as compared to the overall area.  Average to good 
market acceptance is expected going forward.

Highest and Best Use 
57 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
Highest and Best Use 
In appraisal practice, the concept of highest and best use represents the premise upon which 
value is based.  The four criteria the highest and best use must meet are: 
• 
legally permissible; 
• 
physically possible; 
• 
financially feasible; and 
• 
maximally productive. 
The highest and best use analysis of the subject is discussed below.  
AS VACANT 
Legal Permissibility 
The legally permissible uses were discussed in the Site Analysis and Zoning Sections.  
Physical Possibility 
The subject is adequately served by utilities, and has an adequate shape and size, sufficient 
access, etc., to be a separately developable site. There are no known physical reasons why the 
subject site would not support any legally probable development (i.e., it appears adequate for 
development). Existing structures on similar sites provides additional evidence for the physical 
possibility of development. 
Financial Feasibility 
The determination of financial feasibility is dependent primarily on the relationship of supply and 
demand for the legally probable land uses versus the cost to create the uses. As discussed in the 
market analysis, the subject multifamily market is experiencing growth in the number of 
apartment units and rental rates. Development of new multifamily properties has occurred in the 
past few years, and new projects, including the subject are planned.  
Maximum Productivity - Conclusion 
The final test of highest and best use of the site as if vacant is that the use be maximally 
productive, yielding the highest return to the land. 
Based on the information presented above and upon information contained in the market and 
neighborhood analysis, we conclude that the highest and best use of the subject as if vacant 
would be the development of a multifamily property. Our analysis of the subject and its respective 
market characteristics indicate the most likely buyer, as if vacant, would be an investor (land 
speculation) or a developer.

Highest and Best Use 
58 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
AS IMPROVED PROPOSED 
Legal Permissibility 
The site is proposed to be improved with a multifamily development that is a legal, conforming 
use.  
Physical Possibility 
The layout and positioning of the improvements will be functional for multifamily use. While it 
would be physically possible for a wide variety of uses, based on the legal restrictions and the 
design of the improvements, the proposed use of the property for multifamily users would be the 
most functional use.  
Financial Feasibility 
The financial feasibility of a multifamily property is based on the amount of rent which can be 
generated, less operating expenses required to generate that income; if a residual amount exists, 
then the land is being put to a productive use. Based on the income capitalization approach 
conclusion, the subject is capable of producing a positive net cash flow. Additionally, our estimate 
of market value exceeds the project cost and the proposed utilization of the improvements for 
multifamily purposes is considered financially feasible.   
Maximum Productivity - Conclusion 
As shown in the applicable valuation sections, buildings that are like the subject have been 
acquired or continue to be used by multifamily owners/tenants. None of the comparable 
buildings have been acquired for conversion to an alternative use. The most likely buyer for the 
subject property is a regional investor. 
Based on the foregoing, the highest and best use of the property, as improved, is consistent with 
the proposed use as a multifamily development.

The sales utilized represent the best data available for comparison with the subject and were 
selected from commercial development sites within the immediate Billings area, with a focus on 
multifamily land. Our search included broker interviews, the local MLS and Costar. However, 
readers should be reminded that Montana is a non-disclosure state so details regarding real 
property transactions are not a matter of public record. This effectively limits the quantity and 
quality of comparable data.  
Discussion/Analysis of Apartment Land Sales 
MARKET CONDITIONS ADJUSTMENT 
The market conditions adjustment accounts for the difference in market conditions between the 
date of value and the date of sale for the comparables. Billings’ area property sales have seen 
substantial price pressure over the past few years due to growth in population fueled by in-
migration, limited inventory, and increased investor demand. Multifamily rents increased 10% in 
2021. The median home list price increased from $279,900 year end 2020 to $329,000 year 
end 2021 (17.5% increase) and stood at $349,900 as of March 2022. Considering recent 
growth pressures, we have modeled a 5.0% annual upward market conditions adjustment. That 
adjustment is applied starting with the date the comparable property went under contract (when 
known). 
LAND SALE ONE 
This comparable is the sale of an 8.9-acre site at 3038 Central Avenue. The site's shape is 
rectangular, but it is relatively narrow and deep. Its topography is generally level. All utilities were 
available to the site. The site is zoned commercial-mixed use, with potential for office, retail or 
multifamily development. Adjacent uses include an apartment complex, medical office and 
single-family development. Considering its shape and non-corner location, as well as current 
demand in Billings, an apartment use is most probable. The property sold in March 2021 for 
$2,000,000, or $5.18 per square foot.  
This site is centrally located but in an older part of the city with potential for multifamily or office 
use. Its size is smaller than the subject, with a downward adjustment indicated. No other 
adjustments are required.  
LAND SALE TWO 
This comparable is the sale of 2.2 acres at 4200 King Avenue West. The site's shape is 
rectangular, and its topography is as generally level. The property does not actually front on King 
Avenue, but on a feeder street (Kari Lane). All utilities were available to the site. The site is zoned 
CMU2, and the proposed use was reported as an auto collision repair center. The property sold 
in January 2022 for $738,309, or $7.75 per square foot. although not purchased for residential 
development this property shares the same west side location advantages as the subject.  
This property needs downward adjustments for its smaller size and higher intensity development 
potential. It has no arterial street frontage/exposure, with no location adjustment necessary.

LAND SALE THREE 
This comparable is a 16.67-acre site at the SWC of Colton Boulevard and Avenue E, adjacent 
west of the subject site. The property is part of 48 acre planned development, with other portions 
to include apartments and commercial (office). This land is zoned mixed residential, which allows 
residential from one family up to 4 plex buildings. The buyer plans to develop a for sale 
townhome project. All utilities were available to the site.  The property went under contract in 
April 2022 for $3,550,000, or $4.89 per square foot. The contract states a closing date of 
January 9, 2023, for this transaction. 
This comparable needs a significant upward adjustment for its lower allowable density (estimated 
to be 10-15 units per acre maximum).  
LAND SALE FOUR 
This comparable is the recent sale of an 8.152-acre redevelopment site at 934 Lewis Avenue.  
The site is zoned NX3, Mixed Residential. The property is currently improved with a 22,728 SF 
Elks Lodge built in 1967 and a 31,232 SF indoor tennis facility (metal bldg., built 2011). The 
buyer plans to raze those improvements and develop a 200+ unit apartment property. The 
transaction closed in July 2022 for $2,750,000. Demolition costs for the existing buildings were 
estimated at $8 PSF ($430,000 total) via MVS, making the effective purchase price $3,180,000, 
or $8.96 per square foot. 
This comparable requires downward adjustment for its smaller size and location nearer to the 
Billings downtown area.

each comparable.

TOWNHOME/DUPLEX LAND VALUE 
Discussion/Analysis of Townhome/Duplex Land Sales 
This section values the subject townhome (primarily NX1 + P1) and duplex (N2) land. As noted, 
the 2.53-acre site of duplex land is considered excess land as it was originally part of the 
apartment site but was carved out during the entitlement process as a buffer between the 
apartments and the residential subdivision north of Colton Boulevard. The townhome and duplex 
land are discussed below. 
MARKET CONDITIONS ADJUSTMENT 
We have applied a 5.0% annual market conditions adjustment, as previously discussed.

Comparable 3 is the pending sale of the subject and is supported by the remaining comparable 
sales.  
EXCESS (DUPLEX) LAND 
The 2.53-acre duplex (N2) site has the same characteristics as the townhome land, but with a 
smaller land size and lower density. Those factors are generally offsetting, with the same value 
range applicable. The fact that the excess land parcel has no P1 zoning has no impact on 
valuation. As indicated, the site is being used to transition between high-density and low-density 
residential uses. Each unit will have more allocated land.

site.  The property sold in August 2019 for $1,260,000, or $8.07 per square foot ($351,464 per 
acre). This comparable has a hard corner location within the larger new St. Mary's hospital 
campus but no actual arterial street frontage. The buyer had REI in tow and will construct a 
23,000-SF building for the tenant along with a spec 7,500 square foot strip retail building. 
Although this property lacks direct arterial street frontage it has visibility and easy access, with a 
downward adjustment indicated due to its proximity to existing major retail development. A 
downward adjustment for this comparable’s smaller size is also appropriate.  
LAND SALE SIX 
This comparable is the sale of an 8.9-acre site at 3038 Central Avenue. The site's shape is 
rectangular, but it is relatively narrow and deep. Its topography is generally level. All utilities were 
available to the site. The site is zoned commercial-mixed use, with potential for office, retail or 
multifamily development. Adjacent uses include an apartment complex, medical office and 
single-family development. Considering its shape and non-corner location, as well as current 
demand in Billings, an apartment use is most probable. The property sold in March 2021 for 
$2,000,000, or $5.18 per square foot.  
This site is centrally located but in an older part of the city with potential for multifamily or office 
use. When considering potential commercial use an upward adjustment is required in 
comparison to the subject. Brokers interviewed indicated no consistent adjustment for land size 
for retail/office sites between 7 to12 acres, so no size adjustment is warranted. 
LAND SALE SEVEN 
This comparable represents 4.722 acres at 2200 Goodman Road.  All utilities were available to 
the site.  The property sold in April 2022 for $1,028,360, or $5.00 per square foot. This is the 
sale of a rectangular commercial site just south of a primary Interstate 90 interchange. Adjacent 
properties are either vacant land or light industrial uses, but also include a Honda 
motorcycle/ATV sales/service center.  
This property has good access from the freeway but no visibility from that arterial and no major 
street frontage. Aside from the nearby ATV dealership nearby uses are industrial. In comparison 
to the subject a downward size adjustment is needed as well as upward adjustments for the 
subject’s superior location (more suited to office/retail use) and frontage on Zimmerman Trail, an 
arterial street in the neighborhood.  
LAND SALE EIGHT 
This is the sale of a 7.034-acre site just north of the I-90/Zoo Drive exit and is an in-fill piece to 
an existing commercial and retail node. The parcel has visibility from I-90; however, it is located 
behind other buildings and has only a small direct access point from Majestic Lane. The property 
was listed with a local broker and was exposed to the market for six months prior to going under 
contract at reportedly the full asking price. The close date is anticipated to be 60 days, or 
approximately August 15, 2022. The buyer and seller are arm's length, and the sale is concluded

to be a typical market transaction. The property went under contract in June 2022 for 
$1,516,685, or $4.95 per square foot. The buyer's intentions were not disclosed.  
In comparison to the subject an upward adjustment is needed for the subject’s direct 
access/Zimmerman Road frontage, versus this property’s I-90 frontage, but location behind 
existing retail with inferior access.  
LAND SALE NINE 
This comparable is the recent sale of an 8.152-acre redevelopment site at 934 Lewis Avenue.  
The site is zoned NX3, Mixed Residential. The property is currently improved with a 22,728 SF 
Elks Lodge built in 1967 and a 31,232 SF indoor tennis facility (metal bldg., built 2011). The 
buyer plans to raze those improvements and develop a 200+ unit apartment property. The 
transaction closed in July 2022 for $2,750,000. Demolition costs for the existing buildings were 
estimated at $8 PSF ($430,000 total) via MVS, making the effective purchase price $3,180,000, 
or $8.96 per square foot. 
This comparable requires downward adjustment for its smaller size and location nearer to the 
Billings downtown area.

Sale 5 is very comparable in its west side location (although nearer major commercial uses) and 
Sales 8 and 9 are the most recent transactions. Although each of the comparables is considered, 
those comparables are given greatest consideration. 
It is noted that the subject’s owner has a 1.26-acre site at the SWC of Zimmerman Trail and 
Colton Boulevard (a portion of the subject) under contract for $12.50 per square foot. That sale 
assumes the site is subdivided and scheduled to close in January 2023.  
LAND VALUE CONCLUSIONS 
Townhome Land Value 
We have calculated the townhome land value based on the developable land area, with a price 
per square foot indication towards the middle part of the adjusted range the most appropriate for 
the subject.  The value per square foot is based on the land area of the total parcel, including the 
buffer open space. The following table presents the valuation conclusion:

Cost Approach 
In estimating the replacement cost new for the subject, the following methods/data sources have 
been utilized (where available): 
• 
the comparative unit method, utilizing the Marshall Valuation Service (MVS) cost guide, 
published by Marshall and Swift, LLC; 
• 
the subject’s actual construction costs (where available); and  
• 
actual/budget construction cost figures available for comparable properties. 
MARSHALL VALUATION SERVICE 
Direct Cost 
Salient details regarding the direct costs are summarized in the Cost Approach Conclusion at the 
end of this section.  The MVS cost estimates include the following: 
1. average architect’s and engineer’s fees for plans, plan check, building permits and 
survey(s) to establish building line; 
2. normal interest in building funds during the period of construction plus a processing fee 
or service charge; 
3. materials, sales taxes on materials, and labor costs; 
4. normal site preparation including finish grading and excavation for foundation and 
backfill; 
5. utilities from structure to lot line figured for typical setback; 
6. contractor’s overhead and profit, including job supervision, workmen’s compensation, 
fire and liability insurance, unemployment insurance, equipment, temporary facilities, 
security, etc.; 
7. site improvements (included as lump sum additions); and 
8. initial tenant improvement costs are included in MVS cost estimate.  However, additional 
lease-up costs such as advertising, marketing and leasing commissions are not 
included. 
Base building costs (direct costs) are adjusted to reflect the physical characteristics of the subject.  
Making these adjustments, including the appropriate local and current cost multipliers, the direct 
building cost is indicated. 
Additions 
Items not included in the direct building cost estimate include parking and walks, signage, 
landscaping, and miscellaneous site improvements.  The cost for these items is estimated 
separately using the segregated cost sections of the MVS cost guide. 
Indirect Cost Items 
Several indirect cost items are not included in the direct building cost figures derived through the 
MVS cost guide.  These items include developer overhead (general and administrative costs), 
property taxes, legal and insurance costs, local development fees and contingencies, lease-up 
and marketing costs and miscellaneous costs.

The estimates derived via MVS represent replacement cost while the subject’s actual/budgeted 
figures represent reproduction costs. The subject’s budgeted cost was given most consideration 
towards a cost conclusion for the subject.  
ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFIT 
Entrepreneurial profit represents the return to the developer and is separate from contractor’s 
overhead and profit.  Typical profit for multifamily development in this market is 15% to 25%. 
Considering current demand for apartments in Billings we have applied 25% in our analysis.

ACCRUED DEPRECIATION 
There are essentially three sources of accrued depreciation:  
1. physical deterioration, both curable and incurable; 
2. functional obsolescence, both curable and incurable; and  
3. external obsolescence.  
Physical Deterioration

Functional Obsolescence 
Based on a review of the design and layout of the improvements, no forms of curable functional 
obsolescence were noted.  Because replacement cost considers the construction of the subject 
improvements utilizing modern materials and current standards, design and layout, functional 
incurable obsolescence is not applicable. 
External Obsolescence 
Based on a review of the local market and neighborhood, no forms of external obsolescence 
affect the subject.

The value estimate is calculated as follows.

Sales Comparison Approach 
77 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
The sales utilized represent the best data available for comparison with the subject. We initially 
searched within Billings. However, there were not enough local comparable sales, so our search 
was extended into other Montana cities. Note that the comparables are each smaller than the 
subject in terms of project size. However, there is significant demand in the regional apartment 
market and no consistent evidence from our examination of comparable sales that any discount 
exists for larger projects compared to mid-size properties. However, we have made a project size 
adjustment to those comparable sale properties with less than 100 units.    
MARKET CONDITIONS ADJUSTMENT 
The market conditions adjustment accounts for the difference in market conditions between the 
date of value and the date of sale for the comparables. Billings area property sales have seen 
substantial price pressure over the past few years due to growth in population fueled by in-
migration, limited inventory, and increased investor demand. Multifamily rents increased 10% in 
2021.  The median home list price increased from $279,900 year end 2020 to $329,000 year 
end 2021 (17.5% increase) and stands at $349,900 as of March 2022. Considering recent 
growth pressures, we have modeled a 5.0% annual upward market conditions adjustment to pre-
2022 sales. That adjustment is applied starting with the date the comparable property went under 
contract (when known). 
DISCUSSION/ANALYSIS OF IMPROVED SALES 
Improved Sale One 
This comparable is the sale of Black Olive, a midrise apartment property in downtown Bozeman.  
The improvements were completed in 2019 and were in good condition at the time of sale.  The 
average unit size was 953 square feet and project/unit amenities included a tenant lounge, small 
fitness center, elevators, under-building parking, plank flooring, private balconies, quartz 
countertops, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer. The property sold in December 2020 for 
$22,500,000, or $478,723 per unit. Pro Forma (stabilized) net operating income at the time of 
sale was $1,012,500, or $21,543 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 4.50%. In 
addition to the apartments the property has 913 square feet of ground floor retail space leased to 
a local coffee chain for 10 years with an initial lease rate of $25.50 PSF. Although occupancy 
was stabilized the buyers projected additional income for the property due to rent increases and 
potential utility reimbursements.  
This comparable requires downward adjustment for its location in Bozeman, an area which 
generate higher rent levels, as well as its small project size (<50 units), superior finish quality and 
all garage parking. Upward adjustment is needed for this property’s smaller average unit size.  
Improved Sale Two 
This comparable is the sale of a 126-unit midrise apartment property in Billings. The 
improvements were constructed in 2017 and were in average condition at the time of sale. The

average unit size was 932 square feet and project/unit amenities included the following: 
clubhouse, courtyard, cybercafé, dog park, fitness center, hot tub, pool, storage units, detached 
garages, plank flooring, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances. The property sold in 
September 2021 for $34,000,000, or $269,841 per unit. Trailing actual net operating income at 
the time of sale was $1,346,990, or $10,690 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 
3.96%. The property's EGIM was calculated as 13.65 and occupancy at the time of sale was 98%.  
This was an off-market transaction. The buyer believed rents were under market, with immediate 
increases warranted.  
In comparison to the subject this comparable requires upward adjustments for its inferior location 
in an older neighborhood in Billings, its older construction and smaller average unit size.  
Improved Sale Three 
This comparable is Mountainwood Estates, a 101-unit multifamily property situated on a 5.97-
acre parcel at 1101 W. Greenough Drive, Missoula. The improvements were constructed in 1977 
and were considered in average condition at the time of sale. Unit mix includes 51 triplex units 
and 50 garden apartment units. The average unit size was 1,240 square feet. The property 
includes detached garages. The property sold in December 2021 for $30,100,000, or $298,020 
per unit.  Trailing actual net operating income at the time of sale was $881,930, or $8,732 per 
unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 2.93%.  The property's occupancy at the time of sale was 
98%.  Buyer planned capital improvements/renovation of $19,000 per unit. 
This comparable requires a significant upward adjustment for its much older construction, as well 
as the subject’s superior amenities.  
Improved Sale Four 
This comparable is West Village at Four Points, a 72 unit apartment property situated on a 
2.838-acre parcel at 3828 Blondie Court, Bozeman. The improvements were constructed in 
2016 and were in average condition at the time of sale. The average unit size was 927 square 
feet and project/unit amenities included the following: elevators, plank flooring, private patios/ 
balconies, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer. The property sold in 
February 2022 for $23,000,000, or $319,444 per unit.  Trailing actual net operating income at 
the time of sale was reported at $874,000, or $12,139 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate 
of 3.8%.  The occupancy at the time of sale was 96%.  Buyer was required to pay $1.4 million 
penalty on existing loan, included in above sale price. 
This comparable requires downward adjustments for its smaller project size and Bozeman 
location, which generates higher rent levels and more investment interest. Upward adjustments 
are warranted for its older construction, smaller average unit size, lesser amenities and lack of 
garage parking.

Improved Sale Five 
This comparable is the sale of Brooklyn West, a 171-unit garden-style property located at 3904 
Mullan Road in Missoula. The improvements were completed in 2019 and are situated on a 
5.01-acre site. The average unit size was 928 square feet and occupancy was 92%. Project 
amenities include an outdoor barbeque area and clubhouse with a fitness center. Unit finishes

dryer, and a patio or balcony. The project included 269 surface parking spaces. The property 
went under contract in June 2022 for 50,750,000, or $296,784 per unit. Trailing actual net 
operating income $10,819 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 3.65%. The buyer plans 
a significant renovation of the property, budgeted at $2.12 million, equivalent to $12,311 per 
unit. 95% of that will be spent on unit interiors and will include replacing countertops, installing 
new LVP flooring, painting unit interiors, painting cabinets and upgrading hardware and adding 
a smart home package. Other improvements will include new fitness center equipment and 
monument signage. With completion of the renovation the property will be positioned near the 
upper end of the Missoula apartment market. 
This property requires upward adjustment for its inferior finish quality, lesser amenities, smaller 
average unit size and lack of garage parking.

LOSS TO LEASE 
Within the local market, buyers and sellers typically recognize a reduction in potential rental 
income due to the difference between market and contract rental rates.  In this market, lease 
rates are typically flat and are anticipated to roll to market every 9-12 months on average.  As a 
result, actual collections typically lag behind market rates. The subject will lease up as buildings 
are completed, over an approximate 12-month period. We have applied a stabilized loss to lease 
equal to 2.50% of potential rental income. 
CONCESSIONS 
Stabilized properties in the metro area do not offer concessions consistently, but occasionally 
provide them for when an extended vacancy occurs. None of the rent comparables are currently 
offering concessions. Our pro forma does not include an allowance for stabilized concessions.

VACANCY  
The subject’s estimated stabilized occupancy rate was previously discussed in the market analysis 
with vacancy estimated at 5.0%. 
CREDIT LOSS 
The credit loss estimate is an allowance for nonpayment of rent or other income. For our analysis 
the impact of any net credit loss at the property is included in our stabilized vacancy. 
PARKING INCOME 
Parking income is supplemental to that derived from apartment units.  This includes collections 
from sources such as reserved covered parking and/or individual garages. The subject has 76 
detached garages available with the developer estimating rent at $100 per month. The 
comparables offering garages charge between $75-$120 per month. Based on comparable data 
we estimate garage rent of $100 per month. The subject’s parking income is detailed as follows:

Non-Revenue Units 
Non-revenue units represent otherwise rentable units which are not available for lease due to 
their use for other purposes such as employee occupied units and/or model units.  The lost 
revenue, which would have been generated by these units if leased, is deducted as an operating 
expense.  The subject will not have any employee or model units.

Reserves for Replacement 
Reserves for replacement have been estimated based on market parameters. Standard 
underwriting in this market includes replacement reserves as an “above-the-line” expense (i.e. 
deducted prior to capitalization).  We have also consulted the PwC Investor Survey, which 
includes market participant surveys regarding replacement reserves. Responses for participants 
active in the National Apartment Market indicated reserve allowances ranging from $200/unit to

as high as $550/unit, with the majority of responses ranging from $200/unit to $300/unit.  The 
latter range is typical in this market and considering the subject’s new construction we have 
concluded an expense of $250/unit.

DIRECT CAPITALIZATION 
Direct capitalization is a method used to convert a single year’s estimated stabilized net operating 
income into a value indication.  The following subsections represent different techniques for 
deriving an overall capitalization rate. 
Comparable Sales 
The overall capitalization rates (OARs) confirmed for the comparable sales analyzed in the sales 
comparison approach are as follows:

The overall capitalization rates for these sales were derived from the actual or pro-forma income 
characteristics of the property. Capitalization rates have decreased across the region for 
multifamily investment properties over the past 12 months. However, recent rate increases, and 
the current inflationary environment will likely impact capitalization rates going forward. Because

the subject is proposed construction, with pro forma income/expenses, investment risk is 
increased and an OAR rate above those most recent sales is indicated.

The subject is considered to be a Class A property in this suburban market. 
Market Participants 
In deriving an appropriate overall capitalization rate for the subject several market participants 
were interviewed and consulted in gathering applicable information. Each of the brokers reported 
strong interest from national investors in the local apartment market.  All noted that there is 
continuing interest in the mountain region due to the strength of the apartment market and 
consistent growth of the economy.  An investment broker with Colliers noted significant appetite 
from buyers for well located and historically well operated apartment properties.     
Brokers with CBRE, Inc. provided a range of 3.25%-4.00% for Class A properties in the region, 
with the most recent Class B trends from 3.50%-4.50%. Class C properties were quoted as 
varying widely but starting at slightly above the Class B range. Non-stabilized, particularly 
proposed construction, properties would require a higher OAR. The subject would fall within that 
latter category.  
Band of Investment 
The band of investment technique has been utilized as a crosscheck to the foregoing techniques.  
The Mortgage Interest Rate and the Equity Dividend Rate (EDR) are based upon current market 
yields for similar investments.  The analysis is shown in the following table.

Debt Coverage Ratio 
The debt coverage ratio (DCR) is the ratio of net operating income to annual debt service and 
measures the ability of a given property to meet its debt service out of net operating income. 
Utilizing data obtained from knowledgeable mortgage finance professionals, the subject’s 
projected NOI can be tested for reasonableness against the market’s typical loan parameters.

proposed construction, location, and existing market conditions. We have also considered recent 
events and prevailing market conditions with respect to capitalization rates. This includes a

combination of inflationary pressures, higher cost of capital (considering interest rates as well as 
risk spreads), and recent geopolitical events. While the overall long-term outlook for commercial 
real estate remains positive, the full effect of these factors may not yet be reflected in 
transactional data. Overall, we view uncertainty and the higher cost of capital to have an upward 
influence on capitalization rates which is considered with respect to our conclusion herein.

As part of this assignment, we have also estimated the value of Phase 1. Income/expense 
characteristics for that phase are similar to those of the overall property with the exception of 
parking. Phase 1 will have less than a pro rata share, with only 17 garage spaces.  
The capitalization of Phase 1 income and expenses is included below.

The cost approach typically gives a reliable value indication when there is strong support for the 
replacement cost estimate and when there is minimal depreciation. The subject is new 
construction so there is no depreciation present in the property and the reliability of the cost 
approach is adequate. However, investors seldom make decisions on an existing property based 
on replacement cost. Therefore, the cost approach is considered less applicable to the subject 
and is used primarily as a test of reasonableness against the other valuation techniques. 
In the sales comparison approach, the subject is compared to similar properties that have been 
sold recently or for which listing prices or offers are known. The sales used in this analysis are 
considered generally comparable to the subject and the required adjustments were based on 
reasonable and well-supported rationale. In addition, market participants are currently analyzing 
purchase prices on investment properties as they relate to available substitutes in the market.  
Therefore, the sales comparison approach is considered to provide a reliable value indication but 
has been given secondary emphasis in the final value reconciliation   
The income capitalization approach is applicable to the subject since it is an income producing 
property leased in the open market. Market participants are primarily analyzing properties based 
on their income generating capability. Therefore, the income capitalization approach is 
considered a reasonable and substantiated value indicator and has been given primary emphasis 
in the final value estimate. 
As Is Value 
As discussed, the subject is under construction with completion scheduled for May 2024. We have 
estimated the property is 10% complete. We have estimated as is value by subtracting 90% from 
the estimated total replacement cost new, which includes the impact of profit.

Prospective Market Value 
As noted, the subject is under construction with final completion projected by the developer in July 
2025. It is important to consider potential value appreciation over the next three years. Rents in 
the Billings area have had a significant run up over the past five years with an average annual 
increase estimated by Axiometrics at 5.1%. Axiometrics currently projects area rent growth over 
the next five years of approximately 3.8% annually. However, as discussed previously, there is 
currently significant market volatility due to economic conditions, with inflation one of the greatest 
concerns. Although rents have certainly increased across the board in Billings over the past year it 
is likely that expenses have increased by at least the same amount. With continuing economic risk 
and considering the subject’s position at the top of the market in Billings, we have elected not to 
apply an annual growth to the above as if complete and as if stabilized values.  
Based on the foregoing, the market value of the subject has been concluded as follows:

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
107 
Zimmerman Trail Apartments 
© 2022 CBRE, Inc. 
Assumptions and Limiting Conditions 
1. 
CBRE, Inc. through its appraiser (collectively, “CBRE”) has inspected through reasonable observation the subject 
property.  However, it is not possible or reasonably practicable to personally inspect conditions beneath the soil 
and the entire interior and exterior of the improvements on the subject property.  Therefore, no representation is 
made as to such matters.  
2. 
The report, including its conclusions and any portion of such report (the “Report”), is as of the date set forth in the 
letter of transmittal and based upon the information, market, economic, and property conditions and projected 
levels of operation existing as of such date. The dollar amount of any conclusion as to value in the Report is based 
upon the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar on such date.  The Report is subject to change as a result of 
fluctuations in any of the foregoing.  CBRE has no obligation to revise the Report to reflect any such fluctuations or 
other events or conditions which occur subsequent to such date.   
3. 
Unless otherwise expressly noted in the Report, CBRE has assumed that: 
(i) 
Title to the subject property is clear and marketable and that there are no recorded or unrecorded matters or 
exceptions to title that would adversely affect marketability or value. CBRE has not examined title records 
(including without limitation liens, encumbrances, easements, deed restrictions, and other conditions that may 
affect the title or use of the subject property) and makes no representations regarding title or its limitations on 
the use of the subject property.  Insurance against financial loss that may arise out of defects in title should be 
sought from a qualified title insurance company. 
(ii) Existing improvements on the subject property conform to applicable local, state, and federal building codes 
and ordinances, are structurally sound and seismically safe, and have been built and repaired in a workmanlike 
manner according to standard practices; all building systems (mechanical/electrical, HVAC, elevator, plumbing, 
etc.) are in good working order with no major deferred maintenance or repair required; and the roof and 
exterior are in good condition and free from intrusion by the elements.  CBRE has not retained independent 
structural, mechanical, electrical, or civil engineers in connection with this appraisal and, therefore, makes no 
representations relative to the condition of improvements.  CBRE appraisers are not engineers and are not 
qualified to judge matters of an engineering nature, and furthermore structural problems or building system 
problems may not be visible.  It is expressly assumed that any purchaser would, as a precondition to closing a 
sale, obtain a satisfactory engineering report relative to the structural integrity of the property and the integrity 
of building systems.   
(iii) Any proposed improvements, on or off-site, as well as any alterations or repairs considered will be completed in 
a workmanlike manner according to standard practices. 
(iv) Hazardous materials are not present on the subject property.  CBRE is not qualified to detect such substances.  
The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea formaldehyde foam insulation, contaminated groundwater, 
mold, or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property.   
(v) No mineral deposit or subsurface rights of value exist with respect to the subject property, whether gas, liquid, 
or solid, and no air or development rights of value may be transferred.  CBRE has not considered any rights 
associated with extraction or exploration of any resources, unless otherwise expressly noted in the Report.   
(vi) There are no contemplated public initiatives, governmental development controls, rent controls, or changes in 
the present zoning ordinances or regulations governing use, density, or shape that would significantly affect the 
value of the subject property. 
(vii) All required licenses, certificates of occupancy, consents, or other legislative or administrative authority from any 
local, state, nor national government or private entity or organization have been or can be readily obtained or 
renewed for any use on which the Report is based. 
(viii) The subject property is managed and operated in a prudent and competent manner, neither inefficiently or 
super-efficiently. 
(ix) The subject property and its use, management, and operation are in full compliance with all applicable federal, 
state, and local regulations, laws, and restrictions, including without limitation environmental laws, seismic 
hazards, flight patterns, decibel levels/noise envelopes, fire hazards, hillside ordinances, density, allowable 
uses, building codes, permits, and licenses.   
(x) The subject property is in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  CBRE is not qualified 
to assess the subject property’s compliance with the ADA, notwithstanding any discussion of possible readily 
achievable barrier removal construction items in the Report.

Assumptions and Limiting Conditions

(xi) All information regarding the areas and dimensions of the subject property furnished to CBRE are correct, and 
no encroachments exist.  CBRE has neither undertaken any survey of the boundaries of the subject property nor 
reviewed or confirmed the accuracy of any legal description of the subject property.  
Unless otherwise expressly noted in the Report, no issues regarding the foregoing were brought to CBRE’s 
attention, and CBRE has no knowledge of any such facts affecting the subject property.  If any information 
inconsistent with any of the foregoing assumptions is discovered, such information could have a substantial 
negative impact on the Report.  Accordingly, if any such information is subsequently made known to CBRE, CBRE 
reserves the right to amend the Report, which may include the conclusions of the Report.  CBRE assumes no 
responsibility for any conditions regarding the foregoing, or for any expertise or knowledge required to discover 
them.  Any user of the Report is urged to retain an expert in the applicable field(s) for information regarding such 
conditions.   
4. 
CBRE has assumed that all documents, data and information furnished by or behalf of the client, property owner, 
or owner’s representative are accurate and correct, unless otherwise expressly noted in the Report.  Such data and 
information include, without limitation, numerical street addresses, lot and block numbers, Assessor’s Parcel 
Numbers, land dimensions, square footage area of the land, dimensions of the improvements, gross building 
areas, net rentable areas, usable areas, unit count, room count, rent schedules, income data, historical operating 
expenses, budgets, and related data.  Any error in any of the above could have a substantial impact on the Report.  
Accordingly, if any such errors are subsequently made known to CBRE, CBRE reserves the right to amend the 
Report, which may include the conclusions of the Report.  The client and intended user should carefully review all 
assumptions, data, relevant calculations, and conclusions of the Report and should immediately notify CBRE of any 
questions or errors within 30 days after the date of delivery of the Report.  
5. 
CBRE assumes no responsibility (including any obligation to procure the same) for any documents, data or 
information not provided to CBRE, including without limitation any termite inspection, survey or occupancy permit.   
6. 
All furnishings, equipment and business operations have been disregarded with only real property being 
considered in the Report, except as otherwise expressly stated and typically considered part of real property.  
7. 
Any cash flows included in the analysis are forecasts of estimated future operating characteristics based upon the 
information and assumptions contained within the Report.  Any projections of income, expenses and economic 
conditions utilized in the Report, including such cash flows, should be considered as only estimates of the 
expectations of future income and expenses as of the date of the Report and not predictions of the future.  Actual 
results are affected by a number of factors outside the control of CBRE, including without limitation fluctuating 
economic, market, and property conditions.  Actual results may ultimately differ from these projections, and CBRE 
does not warrant any such projections.     
8. 
The Report contains professional opinions and is expressly not intended to serve as any warranty, assurance or 
guarantee of any particular value of the subject property.  Other appraisers may reach different conclusions as to 
the value of the subject property.  Furthermore, market value is highly related to exposure time, promotion effort, 
terms, motivation, and conclusions surrounding the offering of the subject property.  The Report is for the sole 
purpose of providing the intended user with CBRE’s independent professional opinion of the value of the subject 
property as of the date of the Report. Accordingly, CBRE shall not be liable for any losses that arise from any 
investment or lending decisions based upon the Report that the client, intended user, or any buyer, seller, investor, 
or lending institution may undertake related to the subject property, and CBRE has not been compensated to 
assume any of these risks. Nothing contained in the Report shall be construed as any direct or indirect 
recommendation of CBRE to buy, sell, hold, or finance the subject property.  
9. 
No opinion is expressed on matters which may require legal expertise or specialized investigation or knowledge 
beyond that customarily employed by real estate appraisers.  Any user of the Report is advised to retain experts in 
areas that fall outside the scope of the real estate appraisal profession for such matters. 
10. CBRE assumes no responsibility for any costs or consequences arising due to the need, or the lack of need, for 
flood hazard insurance.  An agent for the Federal Flood Insurance Program should be contacted to determine the 
actual need for Flood Hazard Insurance.  
11. Acceptance or use of the Report constitutes full acceptance of these Assumptions and Limiting Conditions and any 
special assumptions set forth in the Report.  It is the responsibility of the user of the Report to read in full, 
comprehend and thus become aware of all such assumptions and limiting conditions.  CBRE assumes no 
responsibility for any situation arising out of the user’s failure to become familiar with and understand the same.   
12. The Report applies to the property as a whole only, and any pro ration or division of the title into fractional 
interests will invalidate such conclusions, unless the Report expressly assumes such pro ration or division of 
interests.

13. The allocations of the total value estimate in the Report between land and improvements apply only to the existing 
use of the subject property.  The allocations of values for each of the land and improvements are not intended to 
be used with any other property or appraisal and are not valid for any such use. 
14. The maps, plats, sketches, graphs, photographs, and exhibits included in this Report are for illustration purposes 
only and shall be utilized only to assist in visualizing matters discussed in the Report.  No such items shall be

15. The Report shall not be duplicated or provided to any unintended users in whole or in part without the written 
consent of CBRE, which consent CBRE may withhold in its sole discretion.  Exempt from this restriction is 
duplication for the internal use of the intended user and its attorneys, accountants, or advisors for the sole benefit 
of the intended user.  Also exempt from this restriction is transmission of the Report pursuant to any requirement of 
any court, governmental authority, or regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the intended user, provided that 
the Report and its contents shall not be published, in whole or in part, in any public document without the written 
consent of CBRE, which consent CBRE may withhold in its sole discretion.  Finally, the Report shall not be made 
available to the public or otherwise used in any offering of the property or any security, as defined by applicable 
law. Any unintended user who may possess the Report is advised that it shall not rely upon the Report or its 
conclusions and that it should rely on its own appraisers, advisors and other consultants for any decision in 
connection with the subject property.  CBRE shall have no liability or responsibility to any such unintended user.

This is the sale of a rectangular commercial site just south of a primary Interstate 90 interchange. Adjacent properties are mostly light industrial 
uses, but also include a Honda motorcycle/ATV sales/service center. The topography is generally level. The listing indicates the property has full 
services to utilities. The transaction was professionally brokered, adequately exposed to the market and the parties to the deal are considered 
arm's length.

Comments
This is the sale of a 7.034-acre site  just north of the I-90 with Zoo Drive Exit, and is one of the last in-fill pieces to an established commercial and 
retail node. The parcel has direct frontage and visibility along I-90; however, the acess from Majestic Lane is from a small point of ingress/egress. 
The property is listed with a local broker and was exposed to the market for six months prior to going under contract at reportedly the full asking 
price. The close date is anticipated to be 60 days, or approximately August 15, 2022. The buyer and seller are arm's length, and the sale is 
concluded to be a typical market transaction. The buyer's intentions were not disclosed.

Comments
Newly built Class A property located in desirable downtown Bozeman.  The property consists of a single, five-story building with 40 ground level, 
under building parking spaces (rent at $95-$125 per month).  In addition to the apartments the property has 913 square feet of ground floor 
retail space leased to a local coffee chain for 10 years with an initial lease rate of $25.50 PSF.  Although occupancy was stabilized the buyers 
projected additional income for the property due to rent increases and potential utility reimbursements.  This was a 1031 exchange on the part of 
the buyers.  The sellers received an unsolicited offer from a regional investor of $20.4 million based on a pro forma year 1 cap rate of 4.40% just 
prior to the above offer and subsequent sale.
This comparable is the sale of Black Olive, a midrise apartment property in downtown Bozeman.  The improvements were completed in 2019 and 
were in good condition at the time of sale.  The average unit size was 953 square feet and project/unit amenities included a tenant lounge, small 
fitness center, elevators, under-building parking, plank flooring, private balconies, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer.  
The property sold in December 2020 for $22,500,000, or $478,723 per unit.  Pro Forma (stabilized) net operating income at the time of sale was 
$1,012,500, or $21,543 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 4.50%.  In addition to the apartments the property has 913 square feet of 
ground floor retail space leased to a local coffee chain for 10 years with an initial lease rate of $25.50 PSF.  Although occupancy was stabilized 
the buyers projected additional income for the property due to rent increases and potential utility reimbursements.

Comments
This comparable is the sale of Brooklyn West, a 171-unit garden-style property located at 3904 Mullan Road in Missoula. The improvements were 
completed in 2019 and are situated on a 5.01-acre site. At the time of sale, the average unit size was 928 square feet and the occupancy was 
92%. Project amenities include an outdoor barbeque area and clubhouse with a fitness center. Unit finishes include a silver appliance package, 
laminate countertops, vinyl and carpet flooring, washer and dryer, and a patio or balcony. The project included 269 surface parking spaces. The 
property went under contract in June 2022 for 50,750,000, or $296,784 per unit. Pro forma (stabilized) net operating income at the time of sale 
was $2,772,495, or $15,921 per unit, for an overall capitalization rate of 5.36. The buyer plans a significant renovation of the property. That 
work is budgeted at $2.12 million, equivalent to $12,311 per unit. 95% of that will be spent on unit interiors and will include replacing 
countertops, installing new LVP flooring, painting unit interiors, painting cabinets and upgrading hardware and adding a smart home package. 
Other improvements will include new fitness center equipment and monument signage. With completion of the renovation the property will be 
positioned near the upper end of the Missoula apartment market.

Bldg Sq. Footage:
0.00 (SF)
Property Status:
Proposed Construction
Building Comments:
 
 
Marketing Status:
Not on the Market
Inspection Requirements:
Full Inspection (An interior and exterior inspection of the subject property in sufficient detail to
determine marketability)
 
Interior inspections of owner or tenant occupied areas will not be required until further notice
or guidance is provided. However, if the situation allows, please continue to inspect vacant
spaces and common areas or any area that you feel comfortable inspecting. The appraisal
should include clear commentary as to what has, or has not been inspected. If any notable
interior area remains uninspected, an interview with an appropriate informed party (owner,
manager, broker, tenant, etc.) is expected in order to determine the nature, quality and
condition of said area(s). This interview should be more in-depth than typically conducted
were the appraiser able to complete their own interior inspection; and cogent details in this
regard should be provided within the appraisal document. To address matters of uncertainty,
the use of an Extraordinary Assumption is allowed regarding the nature, quality, and condition
of any uninspected interior area(s). However, please provide clear commentary as to the
basis of the assumption(s) made (i.e., reliance upon third party sources, interviews, and/or
photos; inclusive of those provided from owners, managers, tenants, the internet, etc.) and
properly disclaim that the employment of said assumption(s) may affect assignment results.
Purpose & Use:   The purpose of the appraisal is to provide your written results of an independent appraisal of the subject property. The appraisal report
will be used to assist First Interstate Bank in making loan underwriting and/or credit lending decisions.
Scope of Work:  Unless specified otherwise in the following text, employ all applicable approaches supportive of the subject's highest and best use and
necessary to provide credible assignment results. Pertaining to scope of work, please consider the following:
     1. Property Information - It is your responsibility to obtain all property specific information, unless otherwise provided, directly from the designated
property representative listed below in order to credibly value the subject property (i.e., leases, operating statements, etc.). If problems persist in the
receipt of information that could jeopardize accuracy and/or timely completion of this assignment, please contact the Commercial Valuation Department
(CVD) immediately.
     2. Estate Valued - For valuations involving a scope of work relevant to a “fee simple” analysis, discovery of any rental agreements in place or
assumed to be in place upon completion (pre-leasing) and/or stabilization, beyond a month-to-month tenancy, requires modification of the requested
estate valued from “fee simple” to “leased fee”; which should be reflected throughout the appraisal report. Alternatively, if no independent 3rd
party lease encumbrances are in place on an assignment engaged as “leased fee”, a valuation of the “fee simple” estate should be undertaken.
Changes in this regard can be accomplished without a revised engagement contract.
     3. Extraordinary Assumptions and/or Hypothetical Conditions - If you find the need to employ an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical
Condition within the appraisal that is not identified or implied within this engagement, you must first contact the Commercial Valuation Department.
Contact must be made in writing, (e-mail preferred) describing the rational for additionally employed assumption/condition. First Interstate Bank will not
accept an appraisal that includes use of an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical Condition that the Bank has not previously approved.
     4. Owner Occupied Space - If the improvements encompass owner occupied or owner related leased space that could be vacated upon the date of
value, the appraiser must identify the most probable buyer of the subject property (investor and/or owner occupant) and reflect in the valuation process
likely market reaction regarding potential deductions (rent loss, tenant improvements, expenses, leasing commissions, etc.) for this space.
     5. Discounted Bulk Wholesale Analysis - If a Discounted Bulk Wholesale value is requested, the appraiser is to include analysis for the retail value
of each unit/lot within the report and provide an electronic copy of said DCF if completed in an Excel workbook. If there is any reason this proves to not
be applicable to a certain assignment, please contact a Commercial Valuation Department representative.
     6. Allocated Values - ALL reported values or interests (e.g., business value, going concern, fractional interest, FF&E, etc.) should be clearly labeled
and segregated in conformance with the value definitions section of the Master Commercial Appraisal Services Agreement (the business value
allocation must be derived based upon a depreciated Marshall & Swift & analysis, or some other empirical data). All values, inclusive of any component
parts, are to be delineated within BOTH your letter of transmittal and the body of the appraisal report.
      7. Marijuana - If in the inspection/appraisal process, there is discovery of any marijuana or illegal drug related activity relevant to the subject property
(i.e., tenancy, growing/manufacturing operations, etc.), it is required that the engaged appraiser immediately provide written notification to a Commercial
Valuation Department representative. If this situation occurs, all work on the assignment should be stopped as the file will be put on hold until further
instructions are received from CVD on how to proceed.

      8. Report/Addendum Supplements – Within your report, please provide the following items:
             a. Location maps for all selected comparables within each applied approach (in relationship to the subject), with photos included for all
                 lease and sale comparables (please provide street level photos for improved commercial/industrial properties).
             b. Letter of Engagement (signed by engaged appraiser)
             c. Appraisal Report Compliance Checklist - attached to the Report Submission Email (not applicable to Restricted Appraisal Report -
                 Evaluation format)
             d. Appraisal License and Qualifications/Resume
     9. Additional Scope of Work, if applicable:
       
If you determine that a change in scope is required, please notify a CVD representative in writing (email preferred) describing the rationale
for the needed change in scope. 
First Interstate Bank will not accept an appraisal that includes a change in scope that the Bank has not previously approved.               
Confidentiality/Fiduciary Duty:
      Personal and confidential information may be provided during this assignment. This information is not to be shared
without the approval by a representative of the Commercial Valuation Department at FIB, unless required by law. Please refer to Master Commercial
Appraisal Services Agreement regarding Confidentiality Clause of nonpublic bank customer and property information.
Release of Appraisal Information:
    The Appraiser shall not provide a draft copy, finished product, or distribution/disclosure of the contents or completion
date of the appraisal report(s) to any other party other than a representative of the Commercial Valuation Department. First Interstate Bank, at its sole
discretion, may release a copy of the Appraisal Report.
Fee:   Not to exceed $8,500.00.  No adjustment to the fee shall be made without prior written consent by a Commercial Valuation Department
representative. Payment for appraisal services will be processed as soon as practical upon receipt of the report. The Commercial Valuation Department
will review the report completed under this agreement. Additional data/analysis may be required, and identified deficiencies must be corrected in a timely
manner, not to exceed 48 hours.

immediately if this deadline will be jeopardized.  If for any reason the appraisal will not be delivered on or near this date, we require notification in writing
as soon as possible, but no later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the delivery date.
Penalties:  The Commercial Valuation Department reserves the right to deduct $200 per day for late delivery of the report. A late fee will not apply if
arrangements are agreed to between CVD and the appraiser after issuance of the engagement letter.
Cancellation:  The Commercial Valuation Department reserves the right to cancel the assignment at any time prior to the delivery date. The appraiser
will be compensated for any work completed prior to the cancellation date.
