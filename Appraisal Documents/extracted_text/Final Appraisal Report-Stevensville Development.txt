RE: 
Appraisal of development land located on North Kootenai Creek Road, Stevensville, 
Ravalli County, Montana (FIB File #12881) 
 
Dear Mr. Driscoll: 
 
Pursuant to your request, I have prepared an appraisal of the above-described property. The 
purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the “As Is” and “As Completed” market value of the fee 
simple estate. I have personally inspected the site and improvements in this report. I certify that I 
have no personal interest, present or contemplated, in the subject property and that this appraisal 
represents my opinion of the market value of the subject property. 
 
As a result of my investigation, the final estimated “As Completed” market value of the fee simple 
estate, as of the date of completion of construction, estimated to be December 31, 2023, is: 
$1,305,000. I further certify that the final estimated “As Is” market value of the fee simple estate, 
as of the date of last inspection, September 12, 2023, is: $1,110,000. The exposure time for the 
subject property is estimated to be less than 12 months. 
 
This letter must remain attached to the report, which contains 36 pages, plus related exhibits, in 
order for the value opinions set forth to be considered valid. Further, this letter of transmittal 
precedes the appraisal report further describing the property and containing the reasoning and most 
pertinent data leading the final value estimates. Your attention is directed to the Assumptions and 
Limiting Conditions and Certification, which are considered usual for this type of assignment and 
have been included within the text of this report. 
 
Sincerely,

SUBJECT:  
Appraisal of development land located on North Kootenai Creek 
Road, in Stevensville, Ravalli County, Montana. 
 
INTRODUCTION: 
 
This is an Appraisal Report that is intended to comply with the reporting requirements set 
forth under Standards Rule 2-2(a) of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice. This report is in a format similar to what formally was referred to as a summary 
report. As such, it presents only summary discussions of the data, reasoning, and analyses 
that were used in the appraisal process to develop the appraisers' opinion of value. 
Supporting documentation concerning the data, reasoning, and analyses is retained in the 
appraisers' file. The depth of discussion contained in this report is specific to the needs of 
the client and for the intended use stated below. The appraiser is not responsible for 
unauthorized use of this report.

PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL: 
 
The purpose of this appraisal is to provide the appraisers' best estimate of the market value 
of the subject real property as of the effective date. Market value is defined by the federal 
financial institutions regulatory agencies as follows: 
 
Market value means the most probable price which a property should bring in a 
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer 
and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not 
affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale 
as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions 
whereby: 
 
(1) 
buyer and seller are typically motivated;  
(2) 
both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they 
consider their own best interests; 
(3) 
a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;  
(4) 
payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial 
arrangements comparable thereto; and 
(5) 
the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected 
by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone 
associated with the sale.

EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTIONS: 
Defined as: 
 
 
An assignment-specific assumption, as of the effective date regarding uncertain information 
used in an analysis, which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser’s opinions or 
conclusions.  
The Appraisal of Real Estate. 14th Edition: Appraisal Institute, 2013, p. 53. 
 
The improvements are proposed, therefore, the value “As Completed” is based on the 
extraordinary assumption that the improvements are completed as described in this report, as 
of December 31, 2023. Should the improvements differ materially from those described in 
this report, I reserve the right to change the final estimate of value accordingly.  
 
Additionally, should the costs of the proposed wells and septic system differ materially from 
the provided estimate, I reserve the right to change the final estimate of value accordingly.

APPRAISAL DEVELOPMENT AND REPORTING PROCESS  
 
In preparing this appraisal, the appraiser: 
 
- 
Inspected the subject site and both the interior and exterior of the buildings. 
Additionally, I have measured each building. 
 
 
- 
Gathered information on comparable land sales. 
 
 
- 
Interviewed several civil engineers and contractors.  
 
 
- 
Interviewed numerous real estate brokers who are familiar with and actively 
involved in the residential market in Ravalli County. 
 
 
- 
Confirmed and analyzed the data and applied the Sales Comparison Approach 
to value.  
 
 
- 
Utilized the Cost Approach to estimate the contributory value of the existing 
and proposed improvements.  
 
 
- 
The Income Approach has not been developed in this analysis. This approach 
is not a primary method of valuation for this property type as it not typically 
purchased for investment purposes. Investors often place significant emphasis 
on the Income Approach when evaluating a property, as it assesses the 
property's capacity to generate income. The omission of this approach does not 
weaken the overall reliability of the final estimate of value.  
 
 
All information pertinent to the valuation of the subject property is contained in the report. 
Supporting documentation used in arriving at market value is retained in the appraiser’s file.

GENERAL AREA ANALYSIS 
 
The subject is located northwest of the city limits of Stevensville, Montana, and south of 
Florence, Montana. Stevensville and Florence are bedroom communities of Missoula, 
Montana, located in the Bitterroot Valley. Missoula is the county seat for Missoula County 
and is located along the Clark Fork River near its confluence with the Bitterroot and Blackfoot 
Rivers in western Montana and at the convergence of five mountain ranges, often described 
as the “hub of five valleys”. Many of the largest employers in Missoula County are located in 
Missoula and include hospital and medical facilities, financial institutions, manufacturing 
facilities, federal, county or city government, retail businesses, restaurants, bars, and small 
locally-owned businesses. The most recent U.S. Census estimate from 2020 reports a 
population of 117,922 and a median household income of $42,103. After Billings, Missoula 
is the second-largest city and metropolitan area in Montana. It is home to the University of 
Montana.  
 
The Bitterroot Valley extends 95 miles from Lost Trail Pass in Idaho to a point near Missoula 
along Interstate 90. Communities within the valley include Lolo, Florence, Stevensville, 
Victor, Corvallis, Hamilton, Darby, Conner, and Sula. The southern end of the valley is split 
into the East and West Forks of the Bitterroot River, and the northern end has its confluence 
of the Bitterroot River with the Clark Fork River. U.S. Highway 93 is the primary roadway 
through the valley. There is a secondary roadway, Highway 269 that also runs through the 
valley.

NEIGHBORHOOD ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
For appraisal purposes a neighborhood is defined in terms of common characteristics, trends, 
and groupings of complementary uses. The subject neighborhood is considered to be the area 
south of Bass Creek Road, north of St Mary’s Road, and west of U.S. Highway 93. The 
western perimeter begins at the west termination point of Bass Creek Road where the Bass 
Creek Trailhead is located and ends at the southern border (St Mary’s Road). The subject is 
located in the northern half of this defined area. 
 
U.S. Highway 93 comprises of a mixture of unimproved ag land and a scattering of 
commercial improvements, primarily light industrial and retail. The remainder of the 
neighborhood consists predominantly of unimproved ag land (irrigated and dryland) and

A visual inspection of the site did not reveal any unusual soil conditions or hazardous waste 
materials that may be present on or under the site. I am not aware of a Phase I Environmental 
Assessment that has been made of the site; therefore, I cannot comment on actual soil 
conditions or the existence of hazardous wastes, if any, on/under the site. I am not an expert 
in detecting hazardous materials that may be present on/under the site, which materials may 
affect the value of the property. 
 
The value estimate is predicated upon the assumption there is no such material on the property. 
Any such environmental risk discovered at a later date may require a revised estimate of value 
that may or may not be simply a reduction of the value by the estimated cost to cure the 
environmental condition. Properties known to have environmental risk may also carry a 
stigma in the marketplace that may or may not affect the value. If future soil tests should 
reveal the existence of any unusual soil conditions or hazardous wastes, I reserve the right to 
review and adjust this appraisal accordingly.

TAXES 
 
The subject is assessed and taxed by Ravalli County. The 2023 assessment and taxes are 
shown below. As of the writing of this report no delinquent taxes are owing on the property. 
 
Assessors Code # – 401210 
 
2023 Assessed Value 
 
2023 Taxes 
Land: 
$        3,777 
Imprvment: 
        63,890 
 Total:            $       67,667 
 
$609.04 
(0.90% of assessed value) 
 
The final estimate of market value “as is” arrived at in this report is $1,110,000, which is 
significantly higher than the assessed value by the Ravalli County Department of Revenue 
(DOR). In all likelihood, the assessed value will be increased in the future to a level that more 
closely reflects market value.  
 
Additionally, the concluded “As Completed” market value with the proposed improvements 
is $1,305,000. Based on a tax rate of 0.90%, the estimated annual tax liability for this lot is 
$11,745 ($1,305,000 x .009 = $11,745).  
 
Taxes as a percentage of assessed value is typical for this market.

HIGHEST AND BEST USE 
 
In estimating the site's highest and best use, legal controls, such as zoning, must be considered, 
along with investor attitudes and the financial feasibility of the alternative uses. Major types 
of real estate uses, consisting of agricultural, residential, recreational, industrial, commercial 
and public use, were analyzed.  It is obvious that several of these uses can be immediately 
eliminated due to zoning restrictions or unsuitability of the site for such a use. 
 
“As Vacant”: 
The subject is located on the outskirts of Stevensville city limits, approximately 1.5 miles 
west of U.S. Highway 93. North Kootenai Creek Road is a lightly traveled graveled county 
road that dead ends at the southwest corner of the subject at the Kootenai Creek Trailhead. 
The topography is slightly sloped with areas of level terrain and slightly wooded areas. The 
surrounding properties include a mixture of unimproved ag land (grazing and production) and 
small acreage homesites. Given the location outside city limits, gravel road access, and the 
topography, commercial development can be eliminated as the highest and best use. This 
leaves residential development.  
 
Over the last three years the residential market in the Bitterroot Valley has experienced a 
drastic increase in demand. This is due to the historically low interest rates from mid-2020 to 
early-2022, paired with the influx of population to the area. This has led to an increase in 
construction. Along with this increase in construction, there has been a dramatic and 
continuous increase in the cost of building materials and laborers. This trend has led to a 
drastic increase in sales prices of all residential properties in the area. As of late-2023, the 
housing market has stabilized, however, the demand and prices for housing remains high. 
 
Given the current housing market, along with the location and access of the subject, I have 
concluded that the highest and best use “as vacant” is development with a residential use.

“As Improved”: 
 
There are currently two older barns located on the northern perimeter of the site. These are 
minimally constructed and have historically been used for equipment and hay storage. These 
are in overall fair to average condition and are well suited for the continued use of storage.  
 
The proposed improvements consist of (2) commercial wells and (1) septic system. The 
commercial wells are to be constructed to meet the requirements of public consumption. 
These requirements are more stringent than private wells, which is the norm in this area. These 
improvements are part of the early phases of infrastructure for an ultra-luxury resort to be 
known as Kootenai Creek Lodge. This type of venue has become increasingly popular in 
recent years in Montana. This is due to the scenic views and recreational activities that 
Montana offers. The Bitterroot Valley is no exception to this as tourism continues to grow, 
along with the popularity of destination weddings with scenic outdoor venues. These 
establishments flourish by blending outdoor adventures with the indulgence of a resort 
experience. In this specific location, this type of property necessitates the utilization of 
commercial wells and multiple septic systems due to the absence of city services. 
Additionally, private wells do not meet the DEQ standards for public consumption.  
 
Based on this information, I have concluded that the highest and best use “as improved” is 
the continued use of storage for the two barns, with the proposed wells and septic system to 
be utilized in the future commercial development of Kootenai Creek Lodge.

SALES COMPARISON APPROACH – AS IS 
 
The value of a property tends to be set by the cost of acquiring an equally desirable substitute 
property. Therefore, in the Sales Comparison Approach market data obtained from sales of 
properties with a reasonable degree of similarity to the subject property are analyzed and 
adjusted to arrive at a value indication. The reliability and similarity of comparable sales data 
tends to determine the reliability and accuracy of this approach. The unit of comparison 
utilized in this approach is price per acre.  
 
Due to the lack of recent sales with improvements similar to the subject, I have analyzed the 
land as vacant. The contributory value of the improvements is addressed following this 
analysis. Five sales have been analyzed in arriving at value for the subject. Each of these sales 
are located in Ravalli County in the Bitterroot Valley and range in size from 40.76 to 80.00 
acres. A map showing their locations is located in the addenda. The chart on the following 
page lists the pertinent information for each sale. The subject is listed on the left-hand side 
for comparison purposes.

October 18, 2023 
Adjustments Made to Sales: 
Transactional: No adjustments were necessary to any of the sales for real property rights 
conveyed, financing terms, conditions of sales, or expenditures made immediately after 
purchase.  
 
Market Conditions: The sales occurred between February, 2021 and June, 2023. The value 
of all types of real estate in this market had increased measurably from mid-2020 to mid-
2022. This is due to the historically low interest rate environment, along with the influx of 
population to the area. In mid-2022, values began to stabilize as activity in the market slowed 
due to the increase in interest rates. For this reason, I have adjusted Sale 5 by 7.5%, Sale 4 by 
5.0%, and Sale 3 by 2.50% for improving market conditions from early-2021 to mid-2022. 
Sale 1 occurred in June, 2023 and Sale 2 in July, 2022. Both sales are considered reflective 
of current market conditions, therefore, an adjustment for market conditions is not warranted. 
 
Property: Property adjustments include items such as location, physical characteristics, 
economic characteristics, legal characteristics, and non-realty components of value. The 
following six areas have been analyzed for adjustment: location, irrigation, utilities, 
topography, size, and zoning. Following is a brief discussion of each sale and my 
determination of overall comparability to the subject.  
 
Discussion of Sales:     
Sale 1: Sale 1 is located along the north side of Dry Gulch Road, approximately 190’ west 
of Store Lane in Stevensville, MT. This location is approximately two miles east of 
Highway 203. Dry Gulch Road is an asphalt paved roadway and there is direct 
access to the site from this road. There is a small, dry creek that runs east/west along 
the south side of the site. The property has a fairly steep slope from north to south 
with areas of level topography and a lightly wooded area along the creek. This was 
used as grazing land at the time of the sale.

     21      
October 18, 2023 
 This sale is inferior to the subject in irrigation, utilities, and topography and similar 
in location, size, and zoning. This sale is inferior to the subject in overall 
comparability.  
 
Sale 2: Sale 2 is located at the southeast corner of Red Crow Road and Wild Rose Lane in 
Victor, MT. This location is approximately two miles southwest of the western edge 
of the city limits of Victor. The site features a mixture of level and slightly sloping 
(from west to east) topography. At the time of the time of the sale there were two 
older homes on the site with a total estimated contributory value of $250,000. For 
analysis purposes, I have deducted the contributory value of these improvements 
from the initial sales price of $1,520,000. This equates to an adjusted sales price of 
$1,270,000 ($1,520,000 – 250,000 = $1,270,000). There is electricity, well, and 
septic on site. Additionally, Gash Creek runs through the northwest quadrant of the 
site, creating water frontage. This was used as grazing land at the time of the sale.  
 
  
 Due to the water frontage from Gash Creek, this sale is superior to the subject in 
location. Additionally, this sale is superior to the subject in utilities, inferior in 
irrigation, and similar in topography, size, and zoning. This sale is superior to the 
subject in overall comparability.   
 
Sale 3: Sale 3 is located on the north side of Jenne Lane, approximately 0.7 miles east of 
Heavens Way in Florence, MT. The site features mostly level topography with a 
lightly wooded ravine along the south side of the site. The property is accessed from 
Jenne Lane, which is a graveled county road. The site has a mixture of level and 
rolling topography, with access to electricity. This was used as grazing land at the 
time of the sale.

October 18, 2023 
  
  This sale is inferior to the subject in irrigation and size and similar in location, 
utilities, topography, and zoning. This sale is inferior to the subject in overall 
comparability.      
 
Sale 4:  Sale 4 is located on the west side of  Longley Lane, south of Pat Lane in Stevensville, 
MT. This is a mostly square shaped parcel with an access “finger” located at the 
southeast corner that provides access from Longley Lane. There is a lightly wooded 
dry creek that runs through the northern half of the site. The property has level 
topography and was being used as irrigated ag production and grazing land at the 
time of sale.   
 
 
This sale is superior in topography and size, inferior in utilities and similar in 
location, irrigation, and zoning. This sale is superior to the subject in overall 
comparability.  
 
Sale 5:  Sale 5 is located west of Illinois Bench Road in Stevensville, MT. Access is via a 
right of way that abuts the southwest corner of the site. Topography is primary level 
with a slight slope from east to west. There is a small dry creek that is lightly wooded 
located in the northeast corner. The CC&R’s primarily permit single family residence 
improvements. Commercial use is not permitted. Theis was used as grazing land at 
the time of the sale.  
 
 
This sale is superior to the subject in size, inferior in location, irrigation, utilities, and 
zoning, and similar in topography. This sale is inferior to the subject in overall 
comparability.

Conclusion of Value: 
 
After adjusting for market conditions, the sales range from $7,175 to $19,538 per acre. These 
sales bracket the subject in overall comparability with two superior and three inferior. Sale 3 
represents the low end of the range. Due to the inferior irrigation, utilities, and size of this 
sale, the subject should command a rate higher than $7,175 per acre. I have given this sale 
limited consideration. Sale 2 represents the  high end of the range. Due to the superior location 
and utilities of this site, the subject should command a rate lower than $19,538 per acre. I 
have given this sale secondary consideration. I have also given secondary consideration to 
Sale 5. Due to the inferior location, irrigation, utilities, and zoning of this sale, the subject 
should command a rate higher than $10,945 per acre.  
 
Primary consideration has been given to Sales 1 and 4. Due to the inferior irrigation, utilities, 
and topography of Sale 1, the subject should command a rate higher than $12,961 per acre. 
On the other hand, due to the superior topography and size of Sale 3, the subject should 
command a rate lower than $17,564 per acre.  
 
Given this information, I have concluded to a market value of $15,200 per acre for the subject. 
This is essentially equal to the mid-point of Sales 1 and 4 and considered reasonable given 
the subjects location, irrigation, utilities, topography, and size.  
 
Based on a value of $15,200 per acre, the market value of the land is calculated as follows:  
 
 
 
 
68.565 acres x $15,200/acre        =      $1,042,188

Improvement Value: 
 
I was unable to find any sales with similar improvements to those of the subject. For this 
reason, I have used the estimated cost after depreciation in order to conclude to the 
contributory value of the two barns. The cost factors for the subject have been taken from 
Marshall Valuation Services (MVS). This is a cost data service providing average 
construction costs for a variety of improvement types and construction qualities with monthly 
updates of local and current cost multipliers. These cost factors are adjusted for local 
conditions. 
 
The cost factor from MVS is taken from Average Quality, Farm Utility Building (477), 
Section 17, Page 26 with a base cost of $15.70 psf and Average Quality, Farm Utility Lean-
tos (124), Section 17, Page 27 with a base cost of $10.75 psf.  
 
I have used the base cost of $15.70 psf for each barn and $10.75 psf for the lean-to. I have 
then estimated depreciation based on the effective age of each structure and a total economic 
life of 30 years. The following chart details my conclusion of the contributory value of the 
improvements.  
 
  
Based on the above calculations, the total contributory value of the two barns equates to 
$67,101.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS 
 
AND 
 
FINAL VALUE ESTIMATE 
 
The Sales Comparison Approach indicates the following “as is” value estimate for the subject 
property: 
Sales Comparison Approach: 
$1,110,000 
 
The Sales Comparison Approach is the method of valuation almost all buyers and sellers of 
vacant land use when analyzing a property for acquisition or disposition. The five sales are 
located in Ravalli County in the Bitterroot Valley within close proximity to the subject. 
Additionally, these sales bracket the subject in location and size. Overall, these five sales 
provide excellent support for the estimated market value. Additionally, the estimated 
contributory value of the improvements, based on a costs after depreciation, has been added 
to the vacant land value. 
 
Based on the analysis of the data and information presented in this report, the final estimated 
“as is” market value, as of the date of last inspection, September12, 2023, is:  
 
One Million One Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars 
($1,110,000) 
 
A reasonable exposure time for the subject is estimated to be less than 12 months. This is 
based on a review of sales activity for similar types of property and assumes competitive 
pricing and competent marketing procedures. The marketing time is also estimated to be less 
than 12 months.

     27      
October 18, 2023 
As Completed: 
 
The “as completed” value is based on the following proposed improvements: (2) commercial 
wells and (1) septic system. These improvements are part of the first phase for an ultra-luxury 
resort to be known as Kootenai Creek Lodge. This facility is to feature a main lodge, employee 
cabins, wedding and event center, glamping cabins, farm to table gourmet dining and 
numerous activities operating year-round. This type of venue has become increasingly 
popular in recent years in Montana. This is due to the scenic views and recreational activities 
that Montana offers. The Bitterroot Valley is no exception to this as tourism continues to 
grow, along with the popularity of destination weddings with scenic outdoor venues. These 
establishments flourish by blending outdoor adventures with the indulgence of a resort 
experience.  
 
The commercial wells are to be constructed to meet the requirements of public consumption. 
These requirements are more stringent than private wells, which is the norm in this area. In 
this specific location, this type of property necessitates the utilization of commercial wells 
due to the absence of city services. Additionally, private wells do not meet the DEQ 
requirements for public consumption. With that said, there is not a significant demand for 
commercial wells in this area due to the limited demand for commercial development outside 
the city limits. 
 
The septic system is to have (1) 2,000 gallon septic tank and (1) 1,000 gallon septic tank with 
(1) 1,000 gallon dosing tank. This will feature a Champion CPSTEP5 ½ HP pump. The drain 
field will have (5) 92’ long trenches that are 36’ wide and 24 - 36’ deep. The manifold is to 
be centered perpendicular to the trenches with (1) 44’ long laterals. Additionally, the manifold 
will consist of 29 feet of of 2” solid pipe with (5) 1.5” diameter laterals.

     28      
October 18, 2023 
I was provided the following estimated costs for these proposed improvements. 
 
 
Gary Peterson, the owner, mentioned that he does not have a projected bid from a well driller 
because it's challenging to provide an estimate without knowing the drilling depth of the well. 
This typically cannot be determined until drilling has begun. Additionally, a projected bid for 
the septic system has not been completed as of the date of this report. The above information 
is based on the owner’s estimated costs. Mr. Peterson reports that he is a general contractor 
in California and has a good understanding of construction costs. 
 
In an interview with Andy Mefford with Professional Consultants, who is the professional 
engineer for the subject, the cost for this type of well typically ranges from $50,000 to $75,000 
per well in this area. This includes costs for drilling, pumps, permits, treatment, and testing. 
Mr. Mefford reports that these costs can vary widely and predominantly depend on the depth 
of the well and the requirements for treatments and testing.  
 
I have also interviewed Scott Aspenlieder, co-owner of Performance Engineering, a civil 
engineering firm that works state-wide. Mr. Aspenlieder believed the costs of $168,000 for 
the wells seemed very high. He also reiterated that these costs can vary widely depending on 
the depth and testing requirements, so it is hard to provide an estimated cost.

     29      
October 18, 2023 
During my research I also interviewed Mike Gooley, co-owner of Elkhorn Excavating, an 
excavating contractor located in Lolo. Mr. Gooley was also of the opinion that the estimated 
cost of $168,000 for the wells is too high, even with the additional treatment and testing costs 
that are required for commercial wells.  
 
Additionally, while completing several other recent appraisal assignments, I interviewed 
several realtors in different markets. The consensus from these interviews indicates that total 
cost for a well (hard and soft costs) generally range between $50,000 and $75,000. This 
provides additional context to the information above. 
 
In regard to the septic system, I have once again referenced my interview with Mr. 
Aspenlieder who reports that septic system costs are typically $25,000 for all hard and soft 
costs. He further reports that due to the dosing system, the cost could potentially go up to 
$50,000. Additionally, in my interview with Mr. Gooley, he agreed that the estimated cost of 
$45,000 for the septic is within reason for this market. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
Based on this information, I have estimated the market value of each well to be $75,000. This 
is equal to the high end of Mr. Mefford’s range, as well as the high end of the range from my 
interviews with realtors throughout Montana. This is considered reasonable given the 
additional requirements of commercial wells for public consumption and the minimal demand 
for this type, and number of wells in this area.  
 
Furthermore, I have estimated the market value of the septic system to be $45,000. This is 
equal to the owner's estimated cost, which is supported by my interviews with Mr. Gooley 
and Mr. Aspenlieder.

     30      
October 18, 2023 
In order to conclude to the total “as completed” market value the estimated contributory value 
of the proposed improvements are added to the previously concluded “as is” value of the land 
and improvements. This is calculated as follows: 
 
 
 
 
“As Is”:  
 
 
 
$1,110,000 
 
 
 
Septic System:  
 
 
45,000

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS 
 
 
This Appraisal Report, the Letter of Transmittal and the Certification of Value are made expressly 
subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions, and any special limiting conditions 
contained in the report which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
1. 
The legal description furnished is assumed to be correct.  I assume no responsibility for 
matters legal in character nor do I render any opinion as to the Title, which is assumed to be 
good.  All existing liens and encumbrances, if any, have been disregarded, and the property is 
appraised as though free and clear, under responsible ownership and competent management. 
 
2. 
The sketch in this report is included to assist the reader in visualizing the property.  I have 
made no survey of the property and assume no responsibility in connection with such matters. 
 
3. 
No responsibility is assumed for accuracy of information furnished by work of others, the 
client, his designee or public records. I am not liable for such information, nor the work of 
possible subcontractors. The comparable data relied upon in this report has been confirmed 
with one or more parties familiar with the transaction or from affidavit or other source thought 
reasonable; all are considered appropriate for inclusion to the best of my factual judgment and 
knowledge. An impractical and uneconomic expenditure of time would be required in 
attempting to furnish unimpeachable verification in all instances, particularly as to 
engineering and market-related information. It is suggested that the client consider 
independent verification as a prerequisite to any transaction involving, sale, lease or other 
significant commitment of funds or subject property. 
 
4. 
This appraisal has been prepared for the exclusive benefit of the client. It may not be used or 
relied upon by any other party. Any party who uses or relies upon any information in this 
report, without the preparer's written consent, does so at his own risk. Possession of this report, 
or a copy thereof, does not carry with it the right of publication, nor may it be used for any 
purpose by any but the applicant without the previous written consent of the appraiser or the 
applicant, and then only with proper qualification. 
 
5. 
The contract for appraisal, consultation or analytical service is fulfilled and the total fee 
payable upon completion of the report. The appraiser or those assisting in preparation of the 
report will not be asked or required to give testimony in court or hearing because of having 
made the appraisal, in full or in part, nor engage in post appraisal consultation with client or 
third parties except under separate and special arrangement and at additional fee. If testimony 
or deposition is required because of any subpoena, the client shall be responsible for any 
additional time, fees and charges regardless of issuing party.  
 
 
6. 
The distribution of the total valuation of this report between land and improvements applies 
only under the existing program of utilization.  The separate valuations for land and building 
must not be used in conjunction with any other appraisal, and are invalid if so used.

7. 
Subsurface rights (minerals and oils) were not considered in making this appraisal. 
 
8. 
This appraiser very carefully inspected the building involved in this Appraisal Report. No 
advice is given regarding mechanical equipment or structural integrity or adequacy, nor soils 
and potential for settlement, drainage, and such (seek assistance from qualified architect 
and/or engineer), nor matters concerning liens, title status, legal marketability (seek legal 
assistance), and such. The lender and owner should inspect the property before any 
disbursement of funds; further, it is likely that the lender or owner may wish to require 
mechanical or structural inspections by qualified and licensed contractors, civil or structural 
engineers, architects, or other experts.  
 
 
9. 
The appraiser has inspected as far as possible by observation, the land and the improvements; 
however, it was not possible to personally observe conditions beneath the soil or hidden 
structural or other components. I have not critically inspected mechanical components 
within the improvements and no representations are made herein as to these matters unless 
specifically stated and considered in the report. The value estimate is predicated on the 
assumption that there is no such material on or in the property that would cause a loss in 
value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for any expertise or 
engineering knowledge required to discover them.  The client is urged to retain an expert in 
this field, if desired. 
 
10. 
The appraisal is based on there being no hidden, unapparent, or apparent conditions of the 
property site, subsoil or structures, nor toxic materials which would render it more or less 
valuable. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, nor for any expertise or 
engineering required to discover them. All mechanical components are assumed to be in 
operation condition and status standard for properties of the subject type. Conditions of 
heating, cooling, ventilating, electrical and plumbing equipment are considered to be 
commensurate with the condition of the balance of the improvements unless otherwise 
stated. No judgment may be made by the appraiser as to adequacy of insulation, type of 
insulation or energy efficiency of the improvements or equipment which is assumed 
standard for subject age and type.  
 
11. 
All furnishings and equipment, except those specifically indicated and typically considered 
as a part of real estate, have been disregarded by this appraiser.  Only the real estate has 
been considered. 
 
12. 
The comparable sales data relied upon in this appraisal is believed to be from reliable sources; 
however, it was not possible to inspect the comparables completely, and it was necessary to 
rely on information furnished by others as to said data; therefore, the value conclusions are 
subject to the correctness and verification of said data. 
 
13. 
The appraiser assumes no responsibility for any costs or consequences arising from the need 
or lack of need for flood hazard insurance. An Agent for the Federal Flood Insurance 
Program should be contacted to determine the actual need for Flood Hazard Insurance.

14. 
Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report shall be conveyed to any person or entity 
other than the appraiser's or firm's client, through advertising, solicitation materials, public 
relations, news, sales, or other media without the written consent and approval of the authors, 
particularly as to valuation conclusions, the identity of the appraiser or firm with which the 
appraiser is connected, or any reference to the Appraisal Institute. Further, the appraiser or 
firm assumes no obligation, liability, or accountability to any third party. If this report is 
placed in the hands of anyone but the client, the client shall make such party aware of all the 
assumptions and limiting conditions of the assignment.  
 
15. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective January 26, 1992. I have not 
made a specific compliance survey and analysis of this property to determine whether or not 
it is in conformity with the various detailed requirements of the ADA. It is possible that a 
compliance survey of the property together with a detailed analysis of the requirements of the 
ADA could reveal that the property is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements 
of the act. If so, this fact could have a negative effect upon the value of the property. Since I 
have no direct evidence relating to this issue, I did not consider possible noncompliance with 
the requirements of ADA in estimating the value of the property. 
 
16. 
The appraisal is based on the premise that there is full compliance with all applicable federal, 
state and local environmental regulations and laws unless otherwise stated in this report; 
further that all applicable zoning, building and use regulations and restrictions of all types 
have been complied with unless otherwise stated in the report. Furthermore, it is assumed that 
all required licenses, consents, permits, or other legislative or administrative authority, local, 
state, federal and/or private entity or organization have been or can be obtained or renewed 
for any use considered in the value estimate. 
  
17. 
The appraiser reserves the right to re-evaluate statements, analysis, conclusions or any value 
estimate in the appraisal if facts become known that are pertinent to the appraisal process and 
which were unknown when the report was finished. 
 
18. 
If this report is placed in the hands of anyone other than the client, the client shall make such 
party aware of all limiting conditions and assumptions of the assignment and related 
discussions.  The appraiser assumes no responsibility for any costs incurred to discover or 
correct any deficiencies of any type present in the property; physically, financially, 
economically or legally. 
 
 
 
ACCEPTANCE OF, AND/OR USE OF THIS APPRAISAL REPORT BY THE CLIENT OR 
ANY THIRD PARTY CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS.

Engagement For Commercial Appraisal Report
Property Location:
NHN North Kootenai Creek Rd, Stevensville, Montana 59870

Dear Brenda McNaney,   :
This is an important document which should be carefully read in its entirety before signing.  Please accept this letter of engagement as authorization to
perform an appraisal completed in conformity with, and subject to, the requirements of regulated institutions under FIRREA and USPAP as provided by the
Appraisal Foundation, the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines ("IA & EG"), and in compliance with the Master Commercial Appraisal Services
Agreement.
By accepting this engagement, you (the addressee) or another qualified appraiser within your company selected by you, agree to review and sign the
report. Both you (the addressee) and the selected appraiser must sign the Letter of Engagement. At least one signature on the report must be that of an
appraiser actively licensed within the state where the subject property is located.

Yes
Inspection Requirements:
Full Inspection (An interior and exterior inspection of the subject property in sufficient detail
to determine marketability)
The appraisal should include clear commentary as to what has or has not been inspected. If
any notable interior area remains uninspected, an interview with an appropriate informed
party (owner, manager, broker, tenant, etc.) is expected in order to determine the nature,
quality and condition of said area(s). This interview should be more in-depth than typically
conducted were the appraiser able to complete their own interior inspection; and cogent
details in this regard should be provided within the appraisal document. To address matters
of uncertainty, the use of an Extraordinary Assumption is allowed regarding the nature,
quality, and condition of any uninspected interior area(s). However, please provide clear
commentary as to the basis of the assumption(s) made (i.e., reliance upon third party
sources, interviews, and/or photos; inclusive of those provided from owners, managers,
tenants, the internet, etc.) and properly disclaim that the employment of said assumption(s)
may affect assignment results.


================================================================================

================================================================================

Engagement Letter
Purpose & Use:  The purpose of the appraisal is to provide your written results of an independent appraisal of the subject property. The appraisal
report will be used to assist First Interstate Bank in making loan underwriting and/or credit decisions specific to the Request Purpose below.
Scope of Work:  Unless specified otherwise in the following text, employ all applicable approaches supportive of the subject's highest and best use
and necessary to provide credible assignment results. Pertaining to scope of work, please consider the following:
1. Property Information - It is your responsibility to obtain all property specific information, unless otherwise provided, directly from the designated
property representative listed below in order to credibly value the subject property (i.e., leases, operating statements, etc.). If problems persist in the
receipt of information that could jeopardize accuracy and/or timely completion of this assignment, please contact the Commercial Valuation
Department (CVD) immediately.
2. Estate Valued - For valuations involving a scope of work relevant to a “fee simple” analysis, discovery of any rental agreements in place or
assumed to be in place upon completion (pre-leasing) and/or stabilization, beyond a month-to-month tenancy, requires modification of the requested
estate valued from “fee simple” to “leased fee”; which should be reflected throughout the appraisal report. Alternatively, if no independent 3rd
party lease encumbrances are in place on an assignment engaged as “leased fee”, a valuation of the “fee simple” estate should be undertaken.
Changes in this regard can be accomplished without a revised engagement contract.
3. Extraordinary Assumptions and/or Hypothetical Conditions - If you find the need to employ an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical
Condition within the appraisal that is not identified or implied within this engagement, you must first contact the Commercial Valuation Department.
Contact must be made in writing, (e-mail preferred) describing the rational for additionally employed assumption/condition. First Interstate Bank will not
accept an appraisal that includes use of an atypical Extraordinary Assumption or Hypothetical Condition that the Bank has not previously approved.
4. Owner Occupied Space - If the improvements encompass owner occupied or owner related leased space that could be vacated upon the date of
value, the appraiser must identify the most probable buyer of the subject property (investor and/or owner occupant) and reflect in the valuation process
likely market reaction regarding potential deductions (rent loss, tenant improvements, expenses, leasing commissions, etc.) for this space.
 5. Discounted Bulk Wholesale Analysis - If a Discounted Bulk Wholesale value is requested, the appraiser is to include analysis for the retail value of
each unit/lot within the report and provide an electronic copy of said DCF if completed in an Excel workbook. If there is any reason this proves to not be
applicable to a certain assignment, please contact a Commercial Valuation Department representative.
6. Allocated Values - ALL reported values or interests (e.g., business value, going concern, fractional interest, FF&E, etc.) should be clearly labeled
and segregated in conformance with the value definitions section of the Master Commercial Appraisal Services Agreement (the business value
allocation must be derived based upon a depreciated Marshall & Swift & analysis, or some other empirical data). All values, inclusive of any component
