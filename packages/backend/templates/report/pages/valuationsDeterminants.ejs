		<p class="title">Market Value</p>
		<p class="subtitle">Determinants</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Market Value</span> - is the estimated amount for which a property, considered in its
			highest and best use, should exchange for on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and
			a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing, wherein the parties had
			each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion or undue pressures.
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			In order to assess a property's market value the authors need to consider the highest and best
			use of the property. Four determinants are typically used in valuating a property's highest
			and best use and they are as follows:
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Legally Allowable</span> - Only those uses that are, or may be, legally allowed which
			may exclude uses that are not, and unlikely to become, allowed by zoning, uses forbidden by
			government regulations, and uses prohibited by deed restrictions or covenants. Properties with
			a use that predates existing zoning regulations may be legally nonconforming. Such
			grandfathered uses are generally legal even though they do not meet current zoning
			regulations. However, some such uses may not be reproduced if the legally nonconforming
			improvement is destroyed or damaged beyond a certain point.
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Physically Possible</span> - Any potential use must be physically possible given the
			size, shape, topography, and other characteristics of the site.
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Financially Feasible</span> - The proposed use of a property must generate adequate
			revenue to justify the costs of construction plus a profit for the developer/investor.
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Maximally Productive</span> - The use must generate the highest net return (profit) to
			the developer/investor.
		</p>

		<p class="regular-description">
			<span>Highest and Best Use</span> - <%= evaluation.high_and_best_user %>
		</p>

		<p class="foot-note">
			For the purpose of this analysis, the author’s assumption of the property’s highest and best
			use is as noted above and its projected use is as such unless otherwise noted.
