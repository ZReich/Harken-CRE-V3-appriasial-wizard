                Estimates the value of property by comparing it to other similar properties in the marketplace that have sold recently. This approach assumes that a buyer is not willing or liable to spend more than they would for an equally desirable property. The Sales Comparison Approach involves finding sold properties comparable to the subject property, and adjusting/comparing the comparable to the subject property based on their inherent difference i.e. (Time, Motivation, Location, Construction, Type/Use and Economies of Scale).
