			The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) became effective in January 1992. The author has not
			made a specific compliance survey or analysis of this property to determine whether it is in
			conformance with the various, detailed requirements of the ADA. The value estimate is
			predicated on the assumption that, except as identified by the author, the subject
			improvements comply with the ADA. It is possible that a comprehensive compliance survey could
			reveal additional areas in which the property does not conform to one or more of the Act’s
			requirements. If so, this could have a negative effect upon the market value or marketability
			of the property.
