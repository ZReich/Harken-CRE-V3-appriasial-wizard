## 🔗 Navigation Flow Updated

### Old Flow (Broken)
```
EVALUATION → evaluation-wizard-full.html (wizard only, no list)
```

### New Flow (Professional)
```
EVALUATION → super-admin-evaluations-list.html (list view)
              └─ Click row or "New Evaluation" → evaluation-wizard-full.html (wizard)
```

This matches standard UX patterns where:
1. Nav button → List view
2. List view → Detail/Create action
